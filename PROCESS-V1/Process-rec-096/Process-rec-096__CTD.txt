Pat: (4 seconds) OK, so a woman um looks to be washing up (1 second) um
but is not paying attention. Um, the sink is overflowing and she’s
standing in a puddle of water, but meanwhile a disaster is brewing
because um one of her children is reaching for the cookie jar, standing
on the stool, and is about to fall over backwards and um there’s another
child who’s kind of watching, um, and um (1 second) yes, it looks like
an impending er (1 second) disaster. Outside um, we’re just looking out
on the street but it doesn’t look like there’s anybody else around, and
just looking at it I, it doesn’t look as if she’s going to respond
before um (1 second) the child topples over backwards and hits his head
on the counter.
