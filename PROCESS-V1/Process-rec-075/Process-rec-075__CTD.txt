Pat: (2 seconds) Oh this is, looks as though it’s a picture of a (1
second) family or part of a family in the kitchen. There’s a lady
standing by the sink drying a plate but doesn’t appear to have noticed
that the water from the sink is overflowing onto the floor. Behind the
sink there’s a window looking out over a neat suburban garden with
curtains over the window drawn back to each side. The kitchen is fitted
with units and at the other side of the kitchen there are two children
trying to get some cookies from a cookie jar. Unfortunately the boy,
the, looks like slightly the older of the two children, er is toppling
over on the stool and is about to fall on the floor (4 seconds).
