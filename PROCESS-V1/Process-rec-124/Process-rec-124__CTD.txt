Pat: Well I guess the lady of the house is er off in another world thinking about other things; her sink is overflowing while she’s absentmindedly drying a plate and her children are standing on a very tall stool which is unsafe and is about to fall over as they’re currently raiding the cookie jar. What on earth is a cookie? It’s a biscuit jar. Er, it’s very American this system. Um, outside it looks like a nice day; she’s got curtains in the kitchen, which is unusual these days, and I don’t know what’s happened to the overflow from the sink cos I would have thought it ought to have operated before the sink er overflowed on the floor. Um, there’s not very much in, no bills and rubbish on the work surface like there is at our house. Er (2 seconds) other than that’s it’s er, that’s about it, I think. (4 seconds) She could do with a bit of a wakeup call, that mother, she’s not paying attention is she? (laughs)
