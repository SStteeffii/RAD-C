Pat: There’s a woman in a dress with an apron, short hair, not bad
build, kinda nice tatas, and she is drying dishes at a sink that is
overflowing because she is imagining running off with her lover and
getting away from these two brat kids that are in her kitchen about to
kill themselves because they’re (coughs) climbing to get cookies out of
the cookie jar in the cupboard and (coughs) little, little (1 second)
Donny there, or whatever his dumb name is (coughs) has lost his balance
and he is falling off his stool while his sister, who has all the
compassion of a rock, is laughing at him. He, in the meanwhile, is about
to crack his head open on the cupboard and the counter and probably old
mum there who is day, daydreaming about her lover will have to take him
to the hospital and get stitches.
