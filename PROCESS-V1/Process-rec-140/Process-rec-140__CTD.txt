Pat: Um, the children are um getting up to mischief um by getting the cookies out of the jar in the kitchen cupboard. The little boy’s standing on a stool which is just about to collapse on him; he’s giving the cookies to his, um presumably his sister or friend um while their mum’s back is turned and she is doing the washing up. Um, unfortunately she looks a bit distracted because the er water in the sink is overflowing. Um (tuts) she’s wiping the plates um dry and looking out of the window; um not sure what she’s looking at but she’s obviously, as I say, been distracted. Um, her, her feet are getting all wet um with the water that’s going onto the floors. Um, there’s um (tuts) the curtains with the tiebacks looking out of the garden, um there’s other houses and trees and a path going up the garden. Um (1 second) (tuts) and I can’t really think of anything else to say on that.
