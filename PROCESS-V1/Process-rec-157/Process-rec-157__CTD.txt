Pat: (3 seconds) OK, well there’s a boy stood on a stool, a three-legged stool, which is obviously overbalanced and he’s obviously looking like he’s about to fall on the ground. Er, he’s got hold of a er, er a cookie jar, so it looks as though that’s going to fall out of the shelf of the er overhead cupboard where he falls over er backwards. Um, there’s a, a woman looking like she’s doing the washing up but left the tap running and the water is flowing over the edge of the sink onto the floor. Um, looks like there’s obviously some malfunction with the um, er (3 seconds) with the waste um overflow pipe in the sink because it should contain excess um, er water rather than allowing it to er go over the top edge of the sink. (2 seconds) Um (2 second) it looks as though she’s got her feet in the water; so I guess that’s going  to make the floor slippery and er put her in peril of er, er slipping. Um, she’s drying a dish er with a cloth, um but if she slips that dish is likely to er fall on the floor and break and could be dangerous. Um (4 seconds) I think, at the moment, that’s probably about as much as I can er see in terms of hazards there. Er, possibly the um young girl is er close to where the er cookie jar is likely to fall out of the cupboard so she might actually get involved in um some other dangers er going on within that er scenario.
