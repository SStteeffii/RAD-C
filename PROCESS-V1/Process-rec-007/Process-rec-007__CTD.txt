Pat: Washing dishes and drying them; the (1 second) sink is overflowing.
Beside it there’s more plates and cups ready to go into wash. Her
children, I assume they’re her children, are behind her and what they’re
doing is raiding the cookie jar by climbing up on top of a stool; the
girl is helping her brother by taking the cookies from him while he’s
tilting back on the stool and it looks as if he’s about to fall. The
lady who’s doing the drying up actually has her feet in the water and is
getting wet, not only because the sink is overflowing but also because
it’s now running across the floor. The cookie jar has its lid off but it
looks as if it’s so full that the lid couldn’t even fit on. Outside the
window, which is curtains, which are held back by some kind of rope,
there’s a garden where you have some kind of trestle and the window
itself is open; you can’t see a great detail in the garden though it
looks as if there may be grass and trees out there; maybe I’m implying
that. The rest of the kitchen looks like a traditional image or cartoon
of a kitchen.
