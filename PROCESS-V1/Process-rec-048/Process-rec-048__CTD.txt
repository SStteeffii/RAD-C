Pat: (2 seconds) The kids are stealing, trying to steal cookies out of
the jar but one of them’s, the boy named John is about to fall; he’s
passing cookies down to his sister, Chloe. Mum is distracted and
probably been on the gin again and there is a flood appearing with water
coming out of the sink; and she’s not really concentrating on that,
she’s bored and more concentrating on something else that’s more
important to her, or worried about something else. There, she is staring
out of the window looking at the grass that is overgrown and, in, in the
front garden, and the gate, where the sun is coming in.
