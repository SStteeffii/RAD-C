Pat: A lady is washing dishes; she’s letting the sink overflow because
she’s left the tap on. A child is (1 second) climbing up on a stool to
get to a cookie jar; he’s opened a cupboard. A daughter is standing at
the bottom of the, the stool um with her arms outrea, reached to catch
him or maybe to catch the cookie. Er, outside the window there are, or
at the window there are curtains and there’s a, looks like a driveway
and possibly a gate, er grass. Er, the curtains are pulled back at the
end so that there’s, they’re on an angle. Er, the cookie jar looks to be
quite full of cookies (sighs) (1 second) there’s something else beside
the cookie jar but I don’t know what that is; it’s kind of a, whether
it’s a, a chopping board or something like that, I don’t know. (4
seconds)
