Pat: (4 seconds) It looks to be a chaotic family scene. The mother looks
to be washing pots up; she seems somewhat distracted. She looks to have
left the tap on and it’s flooded everywhere; and she’s standing in
water. There’s two children behind her trying to get cookies out of the
cookie jar; one’s standing, the boy is standing on the stool trying to
get cookies from the top of the cupboard, the stool’s falling over. The
little girl is standing next to him; she’s holding her hand up in the
air because she wants a cookie. And (1 second) it looks to be in their
family home with a garden outside.
