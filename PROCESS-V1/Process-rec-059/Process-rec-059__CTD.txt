Pat: (2 seconds) I see a woman doing the dishes with an angry look on
her face; she’s not paying attention as the water is overflowing. I see
two children trying to get cookies out of a cookie jar; a little girl is
holding her hand out, a little boy is reaching into the cookie jar, but
he’s about to fall as the stool is precariously leaning in one
direction. Er, the window is open to their house; I can see bushes and a
tree through the window. On the counter next to the lady doing the
dishes is two tea or coffee cups and a plate. She’s wearing a dress with
an apron. The little girl is wearing shoes and socks, er a dress and a
shirt. The little boy is in what appears to be shoes and socks, he’s got
shorts and a shirt on. It appears to be a somewhat nice house as the
kitchen appears to be large. Looking through the window, I’m assuming
that’s another part of the house that extends off to a ninety degree
angle indicating that it will probably be a very large house. Er, it
also looks like there’s some bushes in the front yard and (1 second)
some grass and a tree. (3 seconds) The little boy has (1 second) nicely
done hair, so does the little girl; the mother’s hair appears to be (1
second) er (1 second) well taken care of. Everybody is of a normal
weight. Er, there is no colour in the photograph other than black and
white. Yeah, that’s about it.
