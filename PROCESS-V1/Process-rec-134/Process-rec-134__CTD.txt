Pat: This looks like a picture taking place in the (1 second) the kitchen um of a family. (1 second) Er (1 second) there’s a mother and er a boy and a girl. The children are stealing biscuits from a large cookie jar in a high cupboard; er to reach the cupboard they’ve climbed onto a stool and the boy’s falling from the stool as it topples over. (1 second) The woman in the picture is, has been washing dishes, she looks as though she’s drying them, and the water is overflowing in the sink. She looks absent-minded; her feet are in the water, her slippers probably wet. There’s a window in the kitchen um with an outlook onto the garden, er a garden path, um, and a, a nearby house and trees and a lawn with flowers at the end. Er, the kitchen has um several cupboards and work units in. On the worktop by the kitchen sink there’s a plate and a cup and a bowl. The window has curtains drawn back with a, with a tie (1 second) and it looks like a pelmet at the top. (1 second) The woman is wearing, probably it looks a bit like an old-fashioned pinafore and the children have shorts and short-sleeve tops on. (2 seconds) The picture is in black and white (1 second) drawing; it looks about it could be in the ‘50s. (12 seconds) That’s a summary of it really; that’s all.
