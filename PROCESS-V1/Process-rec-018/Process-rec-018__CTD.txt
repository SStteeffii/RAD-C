Pat: Um, a boy (1 second) is standing on, was standing on er, on a stool
reaching for the cookie jar and he’s just about to fall. His, looks like
his sister is trying to help him. His mother doesn’t seem to have
noticed, she is over by the sink where the water has spilled over onto
the floor and she’s about to get very wet.
