Pat: The sink is overflowing; the woman doing the washing up hasn’t appear to have noticed. Er, a boy is falling off a stool trying to get into the cookie jar, possibly on behalf of his sister. The curtains are drawn back; there’s quite a nice garden view. The kitchen is kind of interestingly clean and modern, um but it’s a rather surreal image actually. It suggests a ni, a negligent mother who’s not paying attention to her children or the washing up; maybe there’s a lover somewhere in the picture, out, out of the picture. It’s an interesting one. Er, that’s about as much as I’ve got to say about it.
