Pat: (2 seconds) There is, this is a picture of a housewife doing some
washing up; she’s drying a plate. The water is overflowing from the
sink. There is a cat sitting on a windowsill outside, I think. Two

which is about to topple over; he’s trying to get biscuits out of the
top shelf in the cupboard. The curtains are open and (sighs) (1 second)
the wife, er the housewife is standing in a puddle of water.
