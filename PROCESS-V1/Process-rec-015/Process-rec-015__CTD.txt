Pat: (8 seconds) Um, a woman washing dishes but the machine is er, not
the machine, the sink is overflowing onto the floor and wetting all her
feet. Er, the male and female child, the male child is stood on a stool
that’s falling over and he’s trying to get a cookie out of something
labelled the cookie jar, and the girl is holding her hand up that she
wants one passing to her. Er, the woman’s side of where she’s stood at
the sink, she’s er wiping a plate with the water splashing onto the
floor, which I’ve already said. There’s two cups and what appears to be
another plate er there already waiting. And the view out of the window
is a garden with a path and what looks like some kinda plant that’s
about two foot high, straggly, and then on the, that’s on the right-hand
side; on the left-hand side there’s like a mound of something that could
be plants, and then something, it looks like it’s another building
through the window, you can see the roof of another building.
