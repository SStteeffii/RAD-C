Pat: Well it’s a kitchen where the mother is (coughs) excuse me (1 second) washing the dishes and drying a plate. The sink is overflowing because the tap is running and the water is spilling onto the floor. Er, the window is open, looking out, looking out onto a garden and has curtains. Er, on the left-hand side of the picture is a cupboard, a wall cupboard with a cookie jar in it and two children trying to get at the cookies in the jar. The boy, a boy and a girl, the boy is standing on a stool reaching for the cookies, but the stool is beginning to tip over, and he’s passing cookies to the girl who is standing next to the stool. (5 seconds) The er mother appears to be wearing an apron of some sort. Through the window you can see a garden and another house, or an extension to this house, with a bush in front of it and a pathway past it, beyond which is a hedge and a tree. Next to the sink there are two cups and a plate; there are fitted cupboards all around the kitchen.
