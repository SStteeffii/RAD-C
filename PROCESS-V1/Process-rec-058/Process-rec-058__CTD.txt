Pat: So on the left-hand side you’ve got what looks like a young girl
with a finger on her mouth, or near her mouth and her left arm reaching
upwards towards her brother, who appears to be stood on top of a stool
which is leaning backwards um as he’s reaching for a cookie jar which is
on the top shelf of a kitchen cabinet, um, and in his left hand he seems
to be passing the young girl a cookie and his right hand is holding onto
the cookies in the cookie jar; and then as you come into the centre it
seems like it’s the corner of the cabinets in the kitchen. And then the
right-hand side of the image is a mother who is washing the dishes;
she’s got a towel in her right hand and she’s wiping a plate. She’s in a
short dress with what looks like an apron around her waist and like
ballet shoes, and the sink is overflowing water onto the floor and, and
over the cabinets, and on the right-hand side of that is a couple of
dishes which have probably already been washed. And then in front of her
um is a windowsill where you can see a bush and another part of a house,
either her own or a different house.
