Pat: Doing washing up; the sink itself is overflowing. (dog barking)
There are two children in the background; a young boy who’s er climbing up
on a stool to get something from the cookie jar and the stool is tipping
over and he’s gonna fall off it. Um, also there’s a window with curtains
and through the window you can see a garden path. There’s also a couple
of cups and a plate on the work surface.
