Pat: Um, in this picture it’s er a kitchen scene um (1 second) with er the usual kitchen cupboards and a sink and a window to the outside world, and there are curtains at the window which are tied back. In front of the window there’s a lady standing, er it looks like she’s drying um a plate with a tea-towel. It looks like she’s got a sort of full length (1 second) er apron on over a, a, a dress, um, and she’s got shoes on her feet; she’s got sort of (1 second) med, well just bobbed hair, just shortish hair and she’s looking out of the window and wiping the plate. Next to her the sink is overflowing with water and the water’s um cascading down onto the floor around her feet but she appears oblivious to this and she’s looking out of the window um (1 second) into what looks like a garden with a path. Behind her there are two children, a girl and a boy; the girl is on the, is standing on the floor and she has sort of shoulder length hair and she’s wearing a dress and it looks like shoes on her feet, and she, her left arm is raised up towards the boy and he is standing, he’s standing on a stool which looks as if it’s about to topple over cos it looks as if it’s just standing on two legs instead of three. He’s reaching up to um a jar in the cupboard which looks like um a biscuit, a biscuit jar, a cookie jar, and he’s taken the lid off and he’s got a biscuit in his left hand which he seems to be handing down to the little girl, um, and he’s got his right hand on, into the cookie jar. Um (1 second) he’s wearing what looks like a t-shirt and shorts and shoes and he’s got shortish dark hair.
