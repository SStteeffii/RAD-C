Pat: (?) but it looks like a kitchen. Um, the mother is.
Oth: (?).
Pat: The, the picture shows a mother (1 second) er washing up; it looks
as though there has been um an accident with the sink, the sink is
overflowing. Um, mother looks a little bit displeased; she’s drying a
plate with a, er a dishcloth or a, a, a tea towel. Um, the kids are
stealing the cookies and the er boy on the stool looks as though he’s
just about to fall off the stool cos the stool is standing on two of
three legs and tilting at an angle. Um, the girl is, got a smirk on her
face, she seems to find it all very amusing. The, the boy is trying to
steal so, er biscuits from the cookie jar and mum, I think, is not quite
aware of what’s going on behind her back, and probably just about to
find out, maybe won’t be too pleased, particularly with the sink
overflowing and things not going well in the department she’s looking
after. Um, out of the window there looks like there’s a, a garden and um
sketches of a, a building overlapping the kitchen. Um (2 seconds) that’s
about as much as I can say really.
