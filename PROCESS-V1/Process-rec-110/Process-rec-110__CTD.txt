Pat: OK. Um, on the left-hand side of the picture a boy is reaching to get some biscuits from a cookie jar; the biscuits are on the top shelf of the cupboard. He’s standing on a stool which is um toppling over so I guess he’s about to fall. It looks like um he’s trying to hand one of the cookies to a little girl who is on his left in the picture. Um (1 second) (tuts) the, the whole scene is set in a, in a kitchen. Um, on the right of the picture er a woman, who I assume is mother, is standing in front of a window looking out into the garden beyond. Um, she appears to be washing or possibly drying crockery; um she hasn’t noticed that the sink is overflowing. Um, she has a plate in her hand, and a cloth. Um (tuts) the window has tie back curtains. Um, outside of the window is a garden with a path leading beyond another bit of building. Um, there’s a shrubbery on the left, hedge on the right, er the lawn. Um, coming back into the room the sink has two taps with um, sorry, yes, two, two taps with the pipe in-between. Um (tuts) the overflowing water is, is running onto the floor around the feet of the wom, woman. Um (tuts) there are cupboards below the work surface um some of which have handles on; the ones in front of the boy and the girl have not. Um (tuts) the woman is dressed in a dress with an apron in front, er she has a short (1 second) hairstyle um (tuts) (1 second) the other two characters, the little girl has short dress, er, and I think she’s got sandals on by the looks of it, um the boy has shorts and a short sleeve shirt, um. (1 second) (tuts) Yeah (2 seconds) I think that is all the (2 seconds) details I can think of to tell you at the moment.
