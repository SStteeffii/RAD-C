Pat: Lady who is busy washing up, and drying; the tap must be over, er
still running, it’s overflowing onto the floor. (2 seconds) The children
are playing up, I should imagine; one’s straddling a, a high stool
wanting probably; can’t see what that says. Is it sweets? Oh.
Oth: No, cookies.
Pat: Cookies (1 second) hoping to; it’s a, it’s a boy and he’s hoping to
get hold of that to perhaps, to probably share with his younger sister
that’s on the ground. There are curtains at the windows, looks like a
drive or a path in the garden. (1 second) Er (1 second) the lady’s
wearing a pinny; I don’t know whether you can say a pinny nowadays,
apron, apron. Er (3 seconds) she’s got he back to them and I, I can’t
blame her because (laughs) we’ve all been there. (laughs) (2 seconds)
She seems very patient or switched off. (laughs) (1 second) Um, the
windows have window panes, small ones. (noise) Ooh. (1 second) (tuts)
Er.
Oth: Just let me know when you’ve finished.
Pat: There are handles on the cupboard doors (1 second) and that’s it.
