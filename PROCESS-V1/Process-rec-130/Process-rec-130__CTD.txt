Pat: OK. Well there’s a lady washing dishes at the sink, which is overflowing and flooding the kitchen. Er, there are some other dirty plates on the top of the worktop. Er, the lady’s wearing a dress and a pinny; she looks quite young. I can see a garden outside with er the path and a bit of lawn. Curtains which are drawn back nearby. There are two children; one is stood on a stool and trying to get to the cookie jar and he’s passing a cookie down to a little girl but the stool is just about to fall over. Er, the cupboard door is open. Er, I think that’s just about everything.
