Pat: Kids, kids getting into the cookie jar; the boy who’s on the stool
is gonna fall over, he’s trying to hand his little sister a cookie.
Mother is not paying attention to the, what the kids are doing; she’s
also not noticing that the sink is overflowing. (coughs) She’s busy
drying a plate. There’s a, a picture through the window; the window is
open and the ca, er above the sink, and I can see er what could be a
garage or it could be another house outside, also a lawn and a pathway.
Then there’s er curtains that are drawn back so that I can see out the
open window. Er, to the right of the sink there’s two coffee cups and a
plate sitting there. Er, mother has er some shoes on; they don’t look
like high heels. Er, the little girl has some kinda shoe on with socks.
The boy has shoes and socks on. Er, the kitchen is arranged to have er
counter tops and the boy that’s getting into the cookie jar has opened a
sh, er a door on the cabinet that’s on the wall.
