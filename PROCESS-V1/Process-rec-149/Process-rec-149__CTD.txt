Pat: Er, do, I press it now to start don’t I?
Oth: No, just.
Pat: Oh. In the, in the um picture I can see er a girl asking a boy to collect something out of a cupboard; he reaches up standing on a stool and falls backward. He was getting something out of a jar. Er, the mother was stood at the sink washing the pots; the sink was overflowing because she was looking out of the window possibly er down the drive. Er, there was a plate and cutlery er on the um, on, on the er side of the sink. Er, the net curtains were open; outside; oh sorry it wasn’t cutlery, it was, I’ve just put my glasses on, it was a cup and saucer, and er her shoes were getting wet through with the er sink overflowing and er outside in the window there was a person, I believe, coming up the drive in the far distance er, um and there was another window and hedge to the left of the picture.
