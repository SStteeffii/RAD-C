Pat: (5 seconds) Um, looks like mum is washing the pots but not really
concentrating on what she’s doing as she’s left the taps on and the
water is spilling onto the kitchen floor. The children (1 second) are (1
second) messing about at the other side of the kitchen, behind the mum,
and get, trying to get into the cookie jar; they’ve got into the cookie
jar but the boy has stu, stumbled on the stool and is in the process of
falling over. (4 seconds) Um, a little girl is trying to get the, the
cookie off him, as he’s falling over, and she seems to be laughing. Um
(3 seconds) (tuts) but mum doesn’t look very happy at all; she looks as
if she’s just in a world of her own, thinking about other things.
Oth: (4 seconds) (?).
