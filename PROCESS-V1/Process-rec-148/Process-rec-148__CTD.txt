Pat: Um, er the mother is wiping the pots and the sink is overflowing with water. Um (2 seconds) er and the children, one, the little boy’s stood on a stool reaching the jar of biscuits in the cupboard and the little girl, the little girl’s standing at the side of him reaching out for him to pass her the biscuits. And outside the window um I can’t really see anything that’s happening out there. Um, er the, the stool is er tippling over with the little boy on so he’s gonna fall in a minute.
