Pat: I can see a young boy reaching for a jar in a cupboard and is in a stool which is tipping down. A young girl is trying to receive the jar and in there there’s (1 second) a woman that’s drying, washing plates and drying them in a kitchen (6 seconds) and the woman has poured, poured some water on the floor and is stepping on it.
