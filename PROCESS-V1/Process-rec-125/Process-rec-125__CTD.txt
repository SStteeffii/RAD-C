Pat: There is a woman washing up, the sink is overflowing, you can see the garden through the window, there’s pots on the side. There are two children; the boy’s climbing on a stool which is falling; he’s trying to get the cookies out of the jar in the cupboard. (4 seconds) The woman is wearing an apron (3 seconds) her feet are getting wet. The curtains are open, the window is open. (8 seconds) In the garden you can see another window in the distance (1 second) and flower beds, a path and the grass.
