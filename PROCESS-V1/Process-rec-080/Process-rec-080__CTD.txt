Pat: (2 seconds) There’s a woman standing at an overflowing sink; her
foot is in the puddle cos the sink is overflowing onto the floor. She’s
drying a plate. The tap is running into the sink; she should stop it.
There are two cups and a plate on the draining board. Through the cur,
the window near her is outside into the garden, a bit of the building, a
border, and the, there are curtains at the window. A bit further along
the working tops around the corner there are two children; there is a
boy standing on a stool and he’s about to topple over. He’s reaching for
the cookie jar which is out of his reach right at the top of a cupboard;
he’s, and he’s got a cookie in each hand, his sister is waiting for one
standing on the floor but he’s about to collapse at the back.
