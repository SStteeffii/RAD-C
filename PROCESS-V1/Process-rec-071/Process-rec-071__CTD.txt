Pat: So there is a scene in a kitchen; there are three people, a mother
and what looks like two children. Well one of them’s on top of a stool
trying to get cookies out of the cookie jar, whilst the mother is at the
sink doing dishes, drying up a plate, but the sink’s overflowing.
There’s a garden outside with a pathway, some grass, um looks like
another house, and a tree in the distance. At the window there are
curtains um either side of it, and the window is open, leading to the
outside. Er, also looks like the little boy that’s getting the cookies
out the jar is almost falling off the chair (laughs) and the little girl
next to him is laughing at his hijinks.
