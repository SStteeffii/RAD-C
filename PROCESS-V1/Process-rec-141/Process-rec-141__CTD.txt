Pat: Mum’s washing up, water’s flooding all over the sink, she’s got a plate in her hand and a tea-towel; she’s drying the pots. Kids are cli, er kids are messing about taking something out, a jar out the cupboard; the boy’s falling off the stool, the girl’s reaching up for something. The cupboard doors are open and er you can see outside the window. Press forward, press forward, press forward.
