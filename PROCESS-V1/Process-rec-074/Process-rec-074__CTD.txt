Pat: It looks like things, it looks like; it’s in a kitchen, it’s a
kitchen scene, um, and it looks like there’s a few accidents that are
about to happen. We have mum stood at the sink washing up and the sink
is overflowing onto the floor causing a, a, perhaps a potential slip
hazard, um, or potential flooding um if she doesn’t turn the taps off.
We have two children who are trying to get to a cookie jar on the top
shelf of one of the cupboards. Um, the girl’s stood on the floor
reaching up for a cookie whilst the boy is stood on a stool which is
starting to tip over and he has his hand in the cookie jar. So the
stool’s starting to tip over and it looks like he could um end up
falling on the floor when it does. Um (1 second) mum’s; the sink is near
the window and we can see out of the window that there’s um what looks
like a nice garden, um, and we can see that there’s um some cups and a
plate on the side, either to wash up or that have been washed up. Um (1
second) that’s as much as I can say really without starting to repeat
myself.
