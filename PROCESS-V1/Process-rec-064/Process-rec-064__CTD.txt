Pat: Children; er the boy is on, standing on top of a stool trying to
get into the cookies on the, on the top shelf of the cupboard, um, and
he’s fa, fa, about to topple off er because he’s unbalanced. The er sink
is overflowing, er water is falling onto the floor and the feet of the
woman who is washing up at the sink. The tap is running and she’s just
letting it run. Um, I can’t quite make out what’s outside. Um (1 second)
and there are a few dishes on the kitchen. The kitchen cabinet doors at
the bottom are all closed. The curtains are open showing the garden and
(1 second) yeah, there’s a tree in the background in the, in the garden.
