Pat: There, there, there’s a lady washing up; er she’s left the taps
running and that’s running onto the floor. There’s (1 second) er a child
on a stool which is falling over; he’s trying to get some cookies out of
a jar. Er, the lid’s off the jar. There’s a girl standing by the side of
him. Cupboard door’s open. There’s er, er it looks like two cups and a
plate on the, er on er s, er worktop. There’s er a, the lady is drying a
plate. Um, and outside the window you can see a garden path, er, and
some building out there and some grass. There’s a pair of curtains which
are tied back, er, they, and they’re in a kitchen.
