Pat: So it’s in a kitchen, looking like a very old like traditional
household, probably from like ‘50s or ‘60s or something. Um, there’s a
boy trying to get up to the cookie jar in a top shelf of the cabinet.
The cabinet door, for some reason, comes out of the square of the (1
second) drawing. Um, he’s falling off of his stool while the little girl
laughs at him. There’s a woman at the sink, she’s washing her dishes
and, for some reason, completely oblivious to the fact that her sink and
entire kitchen seems to be on a slant, cos not only is it just spilling
over onto the side but it’s specifically spilling onto the floor; and
that’s quite the hazard and I think, I don’t think that would um (1
second) that would get away with building regs, to be honest. You can
see the outdoors; they’ve got, I was about to say a garden but it looks
more like a path that goes round a nearby house. Um, yeah, you can see
through that window because the curtains are indeed open mostly. A few
plates and dishes on the side. Yeah, none of the um counter doors are
open, only the cabinet door with the little boy. Um, the woman’s in a
dress, the girl’s in a skirt, the boy’s in shorts and (1 second) yeah,
think that’s about it. (10 seconds) If it can still be heard, for some
question the finish the question button is starting to make my Chrome
freeze (1 second) unsure why. (6 seconds)
