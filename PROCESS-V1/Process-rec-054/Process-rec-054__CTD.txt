Pat: There is a woman standing at an overflowing sink and she is
obviously drying up the plates without concentrating on the fact that
the tap is still running. There are two children, a boy and a girl; the
boy is rea, reaching up for a cookie jar on a stool that looks like it’s
going to fall over, and the girl is actually reaching up to him. (1
second) The puddle on the floor (sighs) is showing splashes. There’s a
window with two tied back curtains through which you can see something
of the outside. Er, the lady is wearing what looks like an apron over a
dress (1 second) her hair, reasonable, just below chin length, er in a
slightly old fashioned style. (2 seconds) Mm (1 seconds) she’s wearing
possibly slippers. The children are wearing shoes (2 seconds) and the
lid is already off the cookie jar so someone is about to help
themselves.
