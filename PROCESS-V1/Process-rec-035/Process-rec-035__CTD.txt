Pat: (1 second) Two kids are looking in the sweet cupboard for cookies
in a jar on a three-legged stool and the mother is wiping the pots and
water is overflowing in the sink. Er, there’s a picture outside the
house of the garden. There’s a plate, saucer and cups to be dried. Er,
it, the lad’s falling off the stool (1 second) in the kitchen (1 second)
and the little girl is watching er the lad on the stool. (1 second)
There’s tiebacks.
