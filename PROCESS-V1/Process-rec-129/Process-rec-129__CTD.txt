Pat: It’s a (1 second) picture of a family in a kitchen. There’s a adult female stood (1 second) at an overflowing sink wiping a plate with a rag or dishcloth. There, there is er (3 seconds) cups, there’s a cup and saucer, bowl and plate on top of the work surface. The water’s overflown from the sink onto the floor and is dripping onto the floor. There’s a ad, er child male stood on a stool which is toppling over and he’s reaching into a cupboard where he’s touching a cookie jar which has got the lid off and what appears to be cookies in the top; he’s got one cookie in his hand. At the side of him, stood on the ground, is a female child with her hand up um (6 seconds) the cupboard door obviously is open. Then I can see (1 second) there, there’s a kitchen window which looks out onto a garden, with curtains which are pulled back on either side of the window, and the window frame appears to be open. (2 seconds) That’s it.
