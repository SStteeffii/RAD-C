Pat: Well I can see a lady washing the pots; unfortunately she’s
overfilled the sink and it’s spilling out onto the floor. Er, and we’ve
got two children then after some cookies in the cupboard; he’s obviously
stood on a stool which is not very safe (clears throat) and the girl’s
stood underneath but she’s likely to get the cookie jar on her head. So
it’s really (1 second) a disaster for accidents to happen in the home.
Um (5 seconds) s, s, she’s wiping the pots (2 seconds) overlooking a
nice garden, by what, looks of it there, and, as I say, the er, the two
children are er obviously going to have an accident, cos he’s falling
off the stool already, so, and the cookie jar is likely to fall on that
girl’s head.
