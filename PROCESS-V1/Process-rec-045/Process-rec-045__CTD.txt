Pat: (2 seconds) A mother, I’m assuming it’s a mother, a woman is
washing up and appears slightly distracted as she’s drying something but
the sink is overflowing. There are two children, a boy and a girl; the
boy is on a stool reaching for a cookie jar but appears to be falling
off. Um, it, outside there is a tree, what looks like a drive to the
house with nothing on it. On the sideboards there are a plate and two
cups. There are (1 second) er one, two, three, four (1 second) five or
six (1 second) cupboards. Um, the young girl is wearing a short skirt,
ankle socks, and what look like sandal type shoes. The boy’s also
wearing shorts, his socks are coming down; I can’t tell what he’s got on
his feet. He’s got a ‘50s sort of haircut. Er, the woman is wearing a
pinafore, phew, regular type of flat-sole shoes. Um (1 second) the sink
has got a, a single faucet and two taps. There are curtains that are
tied back, yeah, they don’t appear to be particularly patterned; they’re
tied back from the middle. I can’t see whether there’s a, a curtain
rail. Um (sighs) there’s a window in the, what looks like the extension,
um sma, with lots of small panes of glass. The garden is laid to shrubs;
looks like grass and hedges in the background. The cookies; hard to tell
what they are, they could be chocolate chip, they’ve got lots of spots
in them. Um (1 second) I think that’s about it.
