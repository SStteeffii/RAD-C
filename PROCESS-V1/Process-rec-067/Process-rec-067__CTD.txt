Pat: (8 seconds) I can see a boy on a stool; he’s trying to reach for a
cookie jar. His sister is waiting for his, for her brother to hand a
cookie. The mother is drying some dishes; however, the sink is
overflowing with water, she doesn’t seem to see it. There’s a garden
that she’s, or a window that she’s looking at. Um, she’s dressed in a (1
second) knee-high dress, um (1 second) the chil, the, the boy’s in
shorts and t-shirt, um the, the girl looks like she’s wearing a skirt
with a t-shirt; um she has her finger placed on her mouth. Um, the boy
has a cookie in his hand as well as reaching for a cookie, the cookie
jar itself.
