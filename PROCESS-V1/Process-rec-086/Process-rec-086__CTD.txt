Pat: Kitchen scene (sighs) the woman is just wiping dishes. The sink is,
the water’s running out of the sink. (2 seconds) There’s a woman’s head
outside, out; oh maybe it’s a planter; there are two children, a boy and
a girl; the boy is standing on a ladder reaching up (1 second) to get
into the cookie jar. (4 seconds) Curtains up at the windows; I can see
one where they’re both tied back. (2 seconds) It looks like two cups on
the sink, side of the sink, and a plate. (2 seconds) Mm. (3 seconds) If
he doesn’t watch out he’s going to fall off the stool. (3 seconds)
Little girl is holding hand, her hand up to receive some cookies out of
the jar. (3 seconds) What else? The woman has an apron on, a full (1
second) apron. (1 second) All the flowers on the windowsill outside. I
can see another house behind (1 second) and what looks like a hedge. (2
seconds) Oh, oh, oh one, two, three, four, five, six (3 seconds) six
cupboards under the sink, three cupboards (1 second) over the work
surface where the children are looking up to get into the cookie jar. (2
seconds) I think that’s about it.
