Pat: (5 seconds) So there’s a, it appears that there’s um a lady, possibly her children, in the kitchen um (2 seconds) mum’s trying to wash up; while she’s washing up the sink’s overflowing. Um, behind her there’s two kids trying to get into the cookie jar; er one of ‘em’s climbed on a stool and it appears that he’s gonna fall off. Um, she’s trying to dry up at the same time as the kitchen’s flooding. Um (2 seconds) there’s a kitchen and um there’s a window which looks out onto the garden and to a neighbouring house. The window’s open. There is some er plates to the right-hand side of the sink. (1 second) Er, the little girl is, appears to be laughing while her possibly brother is falling off the er stool while passing her some cookies.
