Pat: OK, while the mother is (1 second) seeming to dry up the plate,
the, she’s not watching because the water is flowing over the side
(laughs) of the (1 second) um (tuts) sink. There’s some other washing up
needing to be done on the side. The window’s open; it looks like it
might be a nice summer day. Meanwhile, behind the mother’s back, the boy
is trying to steal cookies from the cookie jar in the cupboard but (1
second) the stool is (2 seconds) he looks as though he’s gonna fall off
cos the stool’s tipping over. The, meanwhile the, the girl in the
picture is (1 second) either reaching up for a coo, yeah, reaching up

because the boy’s being cheeky and the mother isn’t (1 second) paying
attention. (laughs) Um, yeah, the mum might also slip over because she,

a path, a garden, a tree. Um (1 second) the way she’s dressed, the way
the kids are dressed, it looks like maybe it's from the ‘60s or ‘70s; um
also with the mother’s haircut. (1 second) Um, yeah, there are two cups
and a plate waiting to be washed up. (1 second) Um, there might be a
gentle breeze; it looks as though the curtains (1 second) might be
billowing a little.
