Pat: OK, er the scene is set in a kitchen; er presumably mother at the sink drying the dishes. There is a sink and the tap is running and overflowing and the water’s spilling onto the floor. Um (tuts) you can see through the open window um another house and driveway, and tree outside. Er, behind the, the mother are two children, a boy and a girl; the boy is stood on a stool which is actually, er appears to be falling over and they are attempting to get cookies out of a cookie jar on the top shelf of a cupboard. Um, the boy’s passing cookies to er (1 second) a young girl, probably his sister, who’s reaching up for them. (tuts) Er, that’s it (1 second) finished.
