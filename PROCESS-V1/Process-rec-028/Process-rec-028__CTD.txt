Pat: Um (1 second) there’s a mum and a boy and a girl in a kitchen;
mum’s doing the wa, washing up, by the looks of it. There’s water on the
floor. (1 second) She’s got some curtains hanging out where she’s
looking out the window, possibly. (1 second) Her son has climbed up to
the cookie jar and is passing the cookies, cookies (1 second) down to
his sister whilst the stool’s (1 second) falls over. (3 seconds) (sighs)
Dunno, dunno what else there is say.
