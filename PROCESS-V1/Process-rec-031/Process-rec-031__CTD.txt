young boy who’s climbed on a stool stealing cookies out of the cupboard
and appears to be falling backwards as he’s passing a cookie to his

sink wiping a plate while the (1 second) er tap is running and the sink
is flowing, overflowing, with the water going on the floor. There’s an
open window from which you can see the garden. Er, there’s a couple of
plates on the side.
