Pat: Ping, I suppose. Cat, just had a cat come in here, cat, dog, guinea
pig, mouse, rat, um (1 second) lion, tiger, cheetah, leopard, wolf (1
second) bear (1 second) um I’ve said guinea pig. Hamster, um (1 second)
kangaroo (1 second) um hyena, zebra (1 second) ostrich; I suppose, I
don’t suppose birds count as animals do they? Do birds count as animals?
I suppose they are. Os, ostrich, um (1 second) ant, though that’s an
insect. Um (1 second) ooh am I running out of animals? Can’t possibly
