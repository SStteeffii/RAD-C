Pat: (3 seconds) A woman is (1 second) washing the dishes in a kitchen
and her sink is overflowing with water. Um (1 second) and a little boy
is on a stool getting cookies out of the cookie jar and it looks like
he, he’s about to fall. Um (1 second) it says cookie jar. He’s, looks
like he has a sister. Um (3 seconds) there’s (1 second) like he’s
wearing a dress, holding a rag. (1 second) There’s a plate and two cups,
curtains. (4 seconds) Mm (2 seconds) yeah, the window looks out; I can’t
tell it’s open or closed but it looks out, it looks like into the yard.
