Pat: (2 seconds) This looks like a mother (1 second) that is distracted;
she’s got the sink overflowing with water while she’s doing dishes.
She’s no doubt got the kids driving her crazy. One boy (1 second) on a
step-stool (1 second) reaching into a cookie jar; looks like the stool’s
falling over so he’s gonna fall and maybe bonk his head. His little
sister’s asking for a cookie and she’s kinda laughing (1 second) and it
is just a very chaotic scene. Looks like there’s, you know, an open
window with a view to the outside that’s above the sink. Um, can’t tell
what kinda day it is cos it’s a black and white picture. (1 second)
That’s it.
