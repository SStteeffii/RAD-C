Pat: (2 seconds) It’s in a kitchen; er a little boy has climbed onto the
chair er, which is now toppling over, so that he can get to the cookie
jar. He is managing to get some out before he falls, and hand them down
to the little girl who’s beneath him. The lady is er washing up at a
kitchen window which is open, er, and her water is flowing out of the
bo, out of the kitchen basin onto the floor. She is drying up a plate;
there is a plate and two cups beside her. The curtains are open (2
seconds) er there are cupboards beneath the, the sink, er (1 second) and
the boy’s cupboard is up, obviously up in the air. Er (1 second) he is
just wearing socks, his sister’s wearing shoes, the mother is wearing
shoes and an apron. Er (1 second) (sighs) gosh, er (2 seconds) (sighs) I
can’t see anything else. Um (2 seconds) what else? The taps are turned
on full, which is why it’s overflowing. Er (1 second) the little boy’s
in shorts and a shirt, the skirt, er the girl is in a skirt and a
t-shirt, er mother’s got a dress on under her apron. You can see the
eaves of the rest of the house through the open window; there are trees
and plants in the garden. (2 seconds) I can’t really see anything else.
