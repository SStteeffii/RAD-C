Pat: I see a scene of absolute chaos in this picture. Mother doesn’t know what the children are doing; the children are having a high old time trying to get to the cookie jar. The lid is off it in an open cupboard. The little boy’s stool on which he is standing is going to topple over any minute now and I’m not sure he or his sister, whom I presume the little girl is, realise what is going to happen, and mother certainly doesn’t know what’s going to happen; I think she’s in dreamland, because not only does she not notice the children she doesn’t notice that the floor is flooding because the water is spilling out of the sink. Er, she’s wiping a plate; she’s probably been doing it for quite a while if she’s got her mind on something else. Out of the window I can see what looks like another house and a path to it, and possibly lawns at the side, or it might be bu (1 second) hedges. Um (2 seconds) there look to be two cups and a plate that mum has already dried up, but why she’s left the taps running I just don’t know. Er, her feet will soon be wet so she’ll realise then. (1 second) Er, and that is a lovely picture. (laughs) What do I press?
