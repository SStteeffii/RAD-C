Pat: Er, two children on a stool trying to take biscuits from a biscuit
er tin in a cupboard, with the boy falling off and the girl er laughing
perhaps. Er, um, um er mother er wa, washing dishes with the sink
overflowing; obviously in some sort of dream, not aware of the water.
And the garden, a garden, large garden, with trees in it, with curtains,
seen through windows with curtains. About five or six cupboards, some,
some plates that have clearly been washed, a tap that’s still running
water (1 second) um, and two handles for the tap or; and sh, the shoes
on the boy looks like boots and the girl looks like sandals and the, and
the er woman looks like er (1 second) sandals as well. Her hair is sh,
the woman’s hair is short, the, the, probably they’re a son and
daughter. The (1 second) um there’s no colouring on the picture at all.
The (1 second) dish in her hand is a plate.
