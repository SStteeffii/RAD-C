Pat: (3 seconds) Um, the picture is of a kitchen, um there’s a mum and
two children (laughs) it looks a bit like a disaster zone. Um, mum seems
to be in a world of her own drying a plate, meanwhile the tap is running
and overflowing out the sink; it’s, water’s going on the floor and she
doesn’t seem to realise it’s a problem. Er, meanwhile the boy is trying
to get some cookies for him and his sister; he’s just handing a cookie
down to his sister while getting another one. The cookie jar is on the
top shelf; he’s standing on a stool and the stool is just about to fall
over. So we are about to have him falling on the floor, probably hitting
his head, mum not really knowing what’s going on. Outside there’s a path
to the garden gate.
