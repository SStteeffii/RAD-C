Pat: (4 seconds) Oh (1 second) it’s in a kitchen scene. Er, the lady at
the sink is in difficulties because the sink is overflowing onto the
floor; she needs to call her insurance company er right away, but
they’ll sort it all out, I’ve no doubt. Um, there’s er a view out the
window and her lawn and I can see some trees and grass growing, and I
think there’s a scaffold out there. There’s a few dishes on the worktop;
two, two what looks like cups and a plate. And the curtains have got
tiebacks on them. And er there’s er a little girl standing on the ground
and what I presume is her brother is balancing very precariously on a
stool on two legs (laughs) I think he’s gonna be on the ground pretty
shortly. He’s at the cookies, cookie jar and he’s, she’s about to
receive one, um, and I think the whole jar could be, is going to be on
the ground very shortly. Er, the er kitchen has got low level (tuts) er
cupboards round, and worktop, and the high level cupboard, which the boy
is er stealing the cookies in.
