Pat: This is a picture of a, a line drawing of a kitchen. Um, there is a woman drying a plate um but she appears to have left the tap running and hasn’t noticed that the sink is overflowing badly, water coming down onto the kitchen floor. Um, there’s also other problems going on. Um, there’s a little boy in the background who is standing on a stool to get the cookie, the cookies from the cookie jar um but it, the stool is tipping and he’s about to fall in, while he’s in the act of handing a cookie to presumably his sister, a little girl. Um, the cupboard, the cupboard door is still open, the cookie jar is in the cupboard; none of the other cupboard doors are open. Um, there’s a scene outside of the window er which is a sash win, window, there are curtains tied back, there are flowers and a driveway and a lawn in the garden. There’s a tree in the distance. There’s a house to the left of the house that we’re in. Um, there are cups, two cups and (1 second) no, one cup, one bowl and one plate (1 second) on the kitchen surface. (1 second) That’s it.
