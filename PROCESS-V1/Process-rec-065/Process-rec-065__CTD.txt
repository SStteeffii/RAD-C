Pat: The mother’s washing up, the sink is overflowing (2 seconds)
there’s a garden outside with the window open and some curtains at the
window. The boy and girl are trying to steal cookies; the boy’s on a
stool and about to fall off and the girl is reaching out. It’s in a
kitchen. There are kitchen cupboards (1 second) the mother has an apron
on and is drying dishes (1 second) there’s some plates on the right-hand
side, maybe waiting to be washed up, there’s a path outside the house.
That’s it, I think.
