Pat: Well in this picture you’re seeing a (1 second) a fa, a family, a
lady at, washing the dishes and water’s overflowing into the floor; er
she’s busy wiping one of the (1 second) er dishes clean with a towel and
she’s got the window open, not much going on outside, er there’s some
dishes left on the counter. And as you move into the picture you see
there’s a young boy about to fall off of a stool that he had to use to
get up into the cookie jar; he’s got a cookie in his left hand, his er;
there’s a young girl has her hand outstretched, trying to grab the
cookie in his hand, and the young boy’s grabbing another cookie and he’s
losing his balance. And that’s the end of this.
