Pat: (2 seconds) The picture is a kitchen in a house. There’s a lady
standing at the sink drying up a plate; the sink is overflowing with
water cos the tap is running. There’s two children in the room, a boy
and a girl; the boy has stood on a stool to reach biscuits from the
cupboard, the cookie jar, er but the stool is toppling over. Er, he’s
handing a biscuit down to a little girl standing on the floor. There’s
curtains at the window of the kitchen. Um, it’s a cupboard on the wa, er
a high cupboard on the wall; there’s cupboards all the way round. The
lady is wearing a dress and an apron. There’s two cups and a plate by
the sink and you can see outside the window there’s a house with bushes
in front of the window; um curtains at the window. The lady’s got shoes
on, the boy’s got t-shirt, shorts and shoes and socks, and the girls got
t-shirt, skirt, shoes and sho, socks. (3 seconds)
