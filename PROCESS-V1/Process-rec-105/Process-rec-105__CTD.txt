Pat: (6 seconds) (sighs) Well (1 second) it’s a kitchen and there’s a
little lad standing on a stool, which he shouldn’t be doing, up at a jam
jar, and the little girl next to him, which is, I presume, his sister,
is just holding her arm out uselessly. And then I go further round the
picture; mum is washing up but she’s had a disaster, she needs a
plumber, I’m just the man, she’s flooding the place, and she’s washing
the plates up but she’s, she’s not doing very well. But er there’s a
pair of lovely curtains in’t there, I didn’t know curtains had them in
the kitchen, but anyhow that’s that. I don’t know what happened to the
little boy, he’s only halfway down, he maybe went full down and (1
second) broke his legs or something. But er she’s got blonde hair, she’s
quite, quite nice, she’s the sorta girl I would go after actually. But
um other than that I can’t think of anything else.
