Pat: (Tuts) There is a woman by a si, an overflowing sink wiping a dish.
Er, on the top beside her there is a plate and two cups. (1 second)
Behind her, at her side, there are two, two children; one is on a stool
that’s toppling over, one is standing on the floor. Um, they’re both er
stealing cookies from the cookie jar in a cupboard. The girl on the, who
is standing on the floor is, has her ar, arm towards her (1 second) um
brother, I suppose, asking for a cookie, and he’s getting more cookies
out of the jar. Out of the window in front of the overflowing sink there
is a picture of a garden which has a footpath and some er hedges, and
another part of the house can be seen outside; er there’s a lawn,
there’s curtains on the window; er the window is open. There are
cupboards underneath the sink um (tuts) and that’s it.
