Pat: The woman is wiping a plate (1 second) in a kitchen at a sink and the sink is overflowing and the water’s on the floor and she’s standing in the water, and there are other pots and plates at the side of the sink above cupboards. Er, she’s facing the window er which has got curtains and she’s looking out into a garden. Er, behind her there are two children um (1 second) one that looks like a boy with short hair on a stool that is toppling over cos he’s reaching up into a top cupboard shelf to get biscuits out of a container that has got cookie jar written on it, and next to him is another child that looks like a girl reaching up to get one of the biscuits from him.
