Pat: Uh a woman, and a mother probably, doing, washing up the dish,
dishes at the end of the day. Her children are also in the same picture
in the kitchen, both a little girl and a, a son. The son is climbing up
on a stool which is falling over, and the little girl is (1 second)
waving her arm about something and intends to, to say something perhaps
about that. Well the mother, well the woman at the sink it’s, the water
has come over the top because the, the plug has obviously been put in
and the tap has meant that it’s pouring out onto the, the floor, er, and
nobody seems to notice. Thank you.
