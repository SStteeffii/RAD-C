Pat: A mother and two children in a kitchen (sighs) the mother is drying
dishes but the sink is overflowing and water pouring out onto the floor.
The children are (2 seconds) messing about; the son is on a stool which
is about, or in the middle of tipping over as he’s trying to reach a
cookie jar on a high shelf in a cupboard, and what’s probably his sister
is standing beside him with her hand up for a cookie for herself, and
she’s beginning to look slightly worried, I think, about him falling
off. Outside, through the window, you can see a path around the house
and some bushes, um despite the fact that there are curtains at the
window, because they are drawn back quite well. There’s some cups and a
plate beside the sink and the mother is wiping up one plate. (3 seconds)
Not much else.
