Pat: Um, scene is in the kitchen. There is a woman who’s drying the
dishes and is probably not concentrating on her job because the sink is
overflowing and the water is falling on the floor as she dries the
plate. She’s looking outside; the window seems to be open and you can
see the garden. Meanwhile the children behind her back are going for the
cookies in the cookie jar on the top shelf in the cupboard and the boy,
seems to be a boy, has stood on the stool, and as he’s handing down the
cookie to the girl who’s putting her finger to the lips and telling him
to be quiet, it looks as though the stool is going to topple over and he
will crash to the ground.
