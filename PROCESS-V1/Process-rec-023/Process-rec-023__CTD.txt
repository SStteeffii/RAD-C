Pat: (Tuts) Er, there are three people in the picture; um (1 second) a
woman er drying dishes, um (1 second) a, a boy climbing on a stool
that’s tipping over, and he’s taking cookies from a jar on the top
shelf, and there’s a girl standing next to him er reaching out,
apparently to take a cookie, and she’s pointing to her mouth but maybe
just er giggling or laughing. The sink er that the woman is standing at
is overflowing with water that’s er flooding the floor. Um, on the
worktop where the sink is there’s a (1 second) two cups and a plate. Er,
the curtains are parted, er the window is open, um, and through the
window can be seen the garden and what looks like um an extension or, or
conservatory or some other building. Er, there’s a lawn, er, and a tree.
Er, the window has window bars er (2 seconds) er glazing bars, I should
say. Um, there are one, two, three, four, five um under counter units
and er one cupboard um that the cookie jar is in. The lid is off the
cookie jar and um, as I said, the boy is taking cookies out of it. Er,
he has one cookie in his left hand, which he may be passing to the
little girl who may be his sister. (2 seconds) Er, there is no colour in
the picture; it’s just monochrome.
