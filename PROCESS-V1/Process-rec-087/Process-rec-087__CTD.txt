Pat: It’s um, it looks (laughs) like chaos. Mum’s trying to do the er
washing but she’s left the taps on and the sink is overfilling; looks
like the surface isn’t square. Her kids are mucking about in the
background; the older one, possibly the boy, is falling off the stool
whilst he’s trying to pinch, no, whilst he’s trying to reach cookies
from the jar in the cupboard. Um, I don’t know whether his sister’s
saying, shush, be quiet, don’t tell mum. But er the window’s open, she’s
probably listening to the birdsong, she’s got too much on her mind, and
er it looks like chaos.
