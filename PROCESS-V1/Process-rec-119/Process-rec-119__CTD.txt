He’s taking (1 second) cookies from the cookie jar in the cupboard. Er, his mother is apparently ignoring him whilst she daydreams looking out of the window with a slightly (1 second) looks like a slightly rural scene, er, and er she’s obviously in a bit of a daydream cos the sink is overflowing and er water is falling onto the floor.
