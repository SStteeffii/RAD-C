Pat: (5 seconds) Er, there’s a scene in a kitchen with a bit of an
absent-minded lady (1 second) standing in the pool of water from the
overflowing sink while she dreamily washes a, wipes a dish. Er, the, no,
nothing happening in the garden. There’s a little path leading out; the
gate is open. There are two children (1 second) playing quite
dangerously; the boy’s about to fall off a stool while he’s stealing
cookies from a cupboard and handing them down to his sister. There’s a
three-legged stool about to fall over. Um (1 second) the curtains are
held back by some sort of ribbon, and the cupboard door is open,
obviously, so the boy can get into it. (3 seconds) The girl’s wearing (1
second) shoes and socks (1 second) the boy’s socks seem to be falling
down, or he’s got loose boots on, I can’t see quite clearly. (2 seconds)
Anyway, the girl seems to be eating one cookie and reaching out for
another one. (3 seconds) And there’s a, the ki, the, the unit with the
sink in has got (1 second) looks like four cupboards which are closed.
