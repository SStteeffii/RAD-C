Pat: Um, it seems to be a woman, probably a mother, standing at the sink
er washing the dishes. Er, she’s left the tap on and the sink is
overflowing and forming a puddle under the sink, er which she’s standing
in. Er, the kitchen sink is in front of a window, er it looks out onto
what could be er a front or a back garden, and to the left of her is a
building which could be a garage or a barn or; no, actually it’s part of
the house because you can see curtains hanging in there. Um, she’s
drying or washing a plate and on the counter in front of her are a
couple of cups and another plate. Um, standing behind her are two
children, a boy and a girl; er the girl has got short socks and short,
flat shoes and a, a short skirt. Um, her brother or the male child is
standing on a stool which is toppling over and just on two legs; so I
think it’s all going to end very badly. Um, he’s got his hands in a
cookie jar; er it looks like there’s a pile of four or five very nice er
chocolate chip cookies or, or chippy cookies. The lid’s off and he’s got
a cookie in his left hand; he looks like he’s trying to take one with
his right for the little girl, er but I suspect in a moment um the
stool’s gonna topple over, he might take the jar with him. I’m really
not sure why the mum’s letting the sink overflow except that I think she
must be very distracted in some way.
