Pat: OK, so there’s a lady washing up at the sink and the sink is
overflow, flowing with water, the water is going onto the floor, she is
standing in the puddle that’s on the floor. There’s a young boy standing
on a three-legged chair trying to pinch the cookies from the cookie jar
but it looks as if it’s going to fall over so he’ll get injured. The lid
is off the cookie jar but the cookie jar is, the cookies are coming out.
It looks er, there’s a little girl there which is waiting for one of the
cookies to be passed to her; she’d stood in the floor. The cupboard door
is open. There is a er window which is, has got curtains and outside the
curtains you can see the side of a house and a path leading towards the
house in which they er, the image is, is shown. There are kitchen units,
there are one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight drawers visible
on the er (1 second) on the units; some have handles, some don’t have
handles. The er, the top window has a um (tuts) er a square er frame
within it, um there are also some plates and cutl, um cups and crockery
on the side of the unit. Um (2 seconds) the lady seems to be wearing a,
a pinny and she’s drying the dishes with a tea towel.
