Pat: (3 seconds) There’s a child reaching up to a cookie jar in the
cupboard, which I don’t think he should be doing cos it’s dangerous and
he’s on a stool and he’s gonna fall off. His sister, who wanted a cookie
jar, who wanted the cookie jar, and he didn’t; oh he’s given her one, he
was gonna give her one, and (1 second) she’s just about to scream about
to her mother that he’s fallen off the stool, he’s gonna bash his head
on the cupboard; that’s awful. She’s distracted by that and let’s the
sink overflow so she’s now got wet feet; and she’s doing the washing up,
or she’s doing the drying up, by the look of it, and um there’s, there’s
cups and saucers in the corner here. And it, over there, behind in the
garden there’s some bushes and a path going away, with a window, or
something, that’s a garage, might be a garage over there. (1 second)
Have I finished the question? What’s happened there? I’ve pressed the
wrong button, that was it.
Oth: Yeah, it’s OK, yeah.
Pat: Is that right? Have I done?
Oth: Yeah, that’s fine.
Pat: Finish question, sorry.
