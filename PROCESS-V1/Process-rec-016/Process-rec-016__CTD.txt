Pat: (2 seconds) There’s a lady in her kitchen doing her washing up;
she’s drying a plate with a tea towel (1 second) and the water is just
pouring out the tap and going onto the floor causing a splash and a (1
second) a mess on the floor. And her two children are going into the
cupboard to get a cookie out the jar; he’s stood on um stool but the
stool is only on (1 second) two legs instead of three, so he looks as if
he’s gonna fall off at any minute, which isn’t very good, cos he’ll fall
and bump his head. And his sister is next to him, reaching up to get the
um (1 second) biscuit from him. (5 seconds) The lady doesn’t look very
happy either; she looks as if she’s got a cross expression on her face.
