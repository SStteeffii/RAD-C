Pat: There is a lady who is washing the dishes and unbeknown to her the tap is over, the sink is overflowing because the taps are open and the water is all over the kitchen floor. There’s a young boy who’s on a stool trying to grab some cookies from the cookie jar; as he’s doing this his stool is kind of um (1 second) arched backwards and he may fall, and his sister or a female girl is stood next to him um reaching out for a cookie from this boy’s hand.
