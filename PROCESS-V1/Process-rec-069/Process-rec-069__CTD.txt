Pat: So there is a lady, Iâ€™m assuming the mother, she is washing dishes
whilst the sink is overflowing and the water is falling over the counter
tops, over the sink onto the floor; she is stepping in the puddle of
water. Er and there is a kid on a stool trying to get the cookie jar
from the open cupboard, er it seems like as though he is falling over
because the stool is falling over. He has a cookie in his hand and he
has his other hand in the cookie jar. And then there is a girl, who is
probably his sister, trying to get the cookie from him, and she is also
laughing.
