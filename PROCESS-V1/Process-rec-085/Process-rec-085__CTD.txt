Pat: OK, this looks like er (1 second) a poster for (1 second) hidden
dangers or, or very visible dangers (laughs) in er the kitchen. There is
the boy falling off the chair er reaching into the co, cookie jar that’s
about to tumble down. There’s the woman standing there with the dishes
overflowing. Um (1 second) she’s standing on water so there’s a, a, I
suppose a, a sli, slip (1 second) s, er well concern of slippage. Er,
she’s looking out the window onto a back garden with the window open; er
are they concerned about burglary? I don’t think they should be cos
nobody’s going to go into that kitchen with her standing there and the
water flowing out. Um, there are cupboards under the sink. Er, there are
some dishes; the size of the sink looks way too small. Um, mm, mm, mm,
mm, mm, looks like the handles are missing on the cupboards (1 second)
so that’s, maybe that’s why they’re keeping the cookie jars
in the top shelves because that’s looks as though they, there’s, there’s
at least one handle that seems to be seen there. The girl is laughing at
her brother cos she wants a cookie, er but she’s also seems to be
shushing ‘em up as though er they don’t want their mu, mum to know
what’s happening. He’s got the lid off the jar, it’s sideways, and he
has a cookie in his hand ready to give to her sister who has her hand
out to receive it.
