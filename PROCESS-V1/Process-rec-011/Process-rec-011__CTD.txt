Pat: There’s a boy on a chair and he looks like he’s tipping over cos
he’s trying to get the cookie jar out the top shelf, and the girl on the
left is er trying to get the, get him to get her some cookies probably.
And the mum’s washing pots and she looks like she’s (1 second) er
daydreaming and the sink is overflowing (1 second) and can’t tell what’s
happening outside, if it’s, what the weather’s like, and the water’s
going everywhere over the floor, and the boy’s just, and the boy’s, on
the left’s just about to fall on the floor.
