Pat: (8 seconds) So there’s a boy standing on a stool which looks as though he’s about to fall off. At the same time (1 second) er he is reaching some cookies from a (1 second) jar in the cupboard to (1 second) hand down (1 second) to a girl who’s standing on the floor, so possibly they are (1 second) related (clears throat) maybe brother and sister, er while it looks as though mum is busy working um (1 second) oh I think she’s doing the washing up actually. (1 second) Er, but it looks as though there’s been an accident and the taps won’t turn off so the water is spilling over (clears throat) from the sink onto the floor and she’s standing in a puddle of water. At the same time she’s continuing to dry er a plate that presumably she’s washed. Um (clears throat) (1 second) outside (1 second) er there looks to be, through, through the window there looks to be some trees and possibly um a lattice fence. The curtains are tied back with ties. Um, on the side there are three other (1 second) utensils.
