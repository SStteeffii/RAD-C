Pat: (1 second) It’s a picture of what I think is a kitchen and there’s a woman in the kitchen who’s drying dishes, oh which I think have been washed; there’s water falling onto the floor from the sink. So the floor is wet and I think her shoes are wet too. She’s wearing a sort of apron over her dress. There are curtains at the window and through the window you can see another house and some garden. On the shelf, sorry, on the base unit near her in the kitchen there is some crockery which she, I think, has dried and put down, and there are kitchen cupboards. There are two children in the room; one of them is on, perched on a stool and about to topple over, he’s actually falling over onto the ground. His arms are reaching out to a chocolate or cookie jar in the cupboard; the cupboard door is open and he’s reaching out to pull out the container, the tin with these things inside, he’s knocked the lid off and he’s just about to pull out the jar with these cookies or whatever they are inside. And there’s a little girl watching him who is holding up her hand as if to help, but she’s not quite sure what she can do. She’s wearing a dress with shoes and he’s wearing shorts and a little jumper, t-shirt, and he’s got shoes on as well. There are kitchen base units and top units where they are, where the children are.
