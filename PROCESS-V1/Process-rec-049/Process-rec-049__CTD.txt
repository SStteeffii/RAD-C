Pat: (1 second) Two kids er going into cupboard on a stool, which they
shouldn’t be. Mum’s got sink running and water’s piling over sink, cos
she’s obviously not watching what she’s doing. Er, she’s washing pots.
Er, she’s looking out of window in garden. (4 seconds) The kids are
reaching for cookies and tool’s about to, er stool’s about to fall over
cos they’re, they’re stood on it wrong.
