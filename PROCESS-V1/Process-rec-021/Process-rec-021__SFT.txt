Pat: Dog, cat, giraffe, lion, mouse, cow, um really find this difficult animals. Horse, calf,
er what you see in a zoo, er I don’t really know. Um, this find it’s
difficult to, it’s not a question I expect anybody to answer, so I don’t
know what I’m gonna do for the next twenty-four minutes because I just
can’t think of more animals and I don’t want to repeat ones I’ve already
mentioned for (?) to your questionnaire, I do not spend my day thinking
about animals, thank you. I’ve still got nineteen to go and you’re
getting no more animals out of me, I’m afraid. (1 second) So fourteenth,
