Pat: Goodness, not; a high risk er picture that you’re showing me.
(laughs) There’s a young boy who is attempting to reach, well he has
reached a cookie jar; um he has a biscuit in one hand, which it looks as
though he’s going to hand it to his sister. But he’s balancing
perilously on a stool; in fact the stool is, has already started to, to
top, er fall over; so he’s at risk of injury. Um, meanwhile his mum er
who’s also in the kitchen, um she has her back to the children so she
doesn’t actually know what’s happening, she’s not aware of the danger
that her son, I’m assuming that’s her son, um that he might be in. She
seems to be a, a little bit preoccupied because she’s drying a dish in
her hand but the sink is actually overflowing and the water’s splashing
onto the floor; and it doesn’t appear that she’s aware of that. So she
obviously has something that’s preoccupying her mind um to that degree
that she’s noticing neither the water that’s splashing on the floor um
nor the danger that her, her boy is in er with the stool about to er (1
second) topple over and, and him potentially being injured.
