Pat: Little boy falling off a chair whilst passing a jar of something to his sister, who is waiting to collect it. The lady of the house is currently washing up from an overfilling er basin. Outside there is a picture of the garden where nobody is  sitting, sitting or using. There are dirty washing, dirty plates to wash um when the lady gets round to it, having soaked her feet in the overflow water. Rather frightening picture in truth. Itâ€™s a daylight picture; therefore the curtains are drawn open. Oh.
