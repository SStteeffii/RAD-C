Pat: I see a little boy and a little girl (1 second) foraging in the cupboard. The little boy looks like he’s going to, he’s reaching up high for a jar, a cookie jar it looks like, to pass down one of them to the little girl, but in the process it looks like the stool is going to fall over. They’ve also got the cupboard door wide open. There is a lovely wide picture window in front of the kitchen sink, which is overflowing; it has two taps and through the window I can see another house with Georgian windows. It looks like the mother has got a tea-towel and she’s drying one of the plates and she’s stood in a pool of water where the sink is overflowing. To the side it looks like there’s a plate and two cups above a cupboard with two handles. (1 second) The little girl is wearing ankle socks and a skirt and she’s got (1 second) I would guess, blonde shoulder-length hair. Er, what else can I see? The curtains are on a pole and they’ve got tie-backs on them and they’re gathered joining in the middle. (4 seconds) And that’s about it.
