Pat: (1 second) There is a kitchen scene in which the (1 second) mother
dressed in a shift dress with an apron on is distracted whilst drying a
plate. Um, her sink is overflowing with water and she hasn’t realised.
Um, there are dirty dishes on the side that she’s yet to wash. She’s
facing an open window um with curtains hanging at the window overlooking
her garden. Um, she has water on the floor er which she’s stood in and
she hasn’t noticed it’s dripped all down the front of the kitchen
cupboards. Her children in the meantime, unbeknown to her, are (1
second) using the kitchen stool; the boy is reaching up to get cookies
out of the cookie jar and pass them down to his sister who has her hand
outstretched waiting to receive one. Um, the children are dressed in
summer clothing; the girl with short socks and a skirt and a t-shirt and
the boy with his um shorts and t-shirt on. Um, um, it gives the illusion
of being um a warm time of the year with the window being open and the
type of clothing that they’re wearing.
