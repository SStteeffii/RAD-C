Pat: This shows a picture of a mother washing up in the sink where the
water is rowing, um (tuts) flowing over the side; she’s trying to wipe a
plate. She’s looking away from two children who are behind her; she’s
actually at an open window, by the looks of things. The children behind
her are messing about um looking for some biscuits from a cookie jar, by
the looks of things. There’s a girl and a boy; the little boy has
climbed onto a three-legged stool, um, and he has his hand in the cookie
jar. The little girl is on his left; and the stool is toppling, is
beginning to topple backwards and she’s thrown up her um left arm um
presumably in horror, I don’t know, can’t really see their faces
properly. Um (5 seconds) other than that, there’s wash, er there are
bits of crockery on the side where mum is doing the um washing up (1
second) and she’s obviously not seen what the children are doing. (4
seconds) The curtains are (1 second) part um (?) yeah.
