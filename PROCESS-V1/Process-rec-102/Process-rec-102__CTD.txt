Pat: Er, there is a boy precariously (1 second) on a foot stool, which
might topple, being watched by a girl with her hand up, as he pulls a
cookie out of the cookie jar, er while his presumed mother has his back
to them as sheâ€™s washing or drying a dish, but meanwhile water is
pouring out of the sink onto the floor. The curtains are open so the
view of the garden outside er is there. (1 second) Er, cupboards are
shut, er, and the mother is, actually has her shoe in a puddle of water.
