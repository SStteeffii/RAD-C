Pat: Er, I would assume that the lady is the mother of the family; she
is drying some dishes that she would have just washed but she seems to
have left the tap on because the sink is overflowing. Then you have two
children (1 second) er the girl is somehow holding her arm up; the boy
has taken (1 second) a set of um (1 second) steps or something that he
can stand on and he is taking er, we would call them biscuits but he's
taking cookies, the American word cookie, and she has her hand out in
order for him to have, take one from him; however, he’s about to fall
off the stool because it seems to be tilting backwards, and the mother
has absolutely no idea what the children are up to. She is standing in
front of a window that has curtains and you can see into their garden;
there’s hedges, possibly a path. The curtains are held back by a loop.
She seems to be standing in the water that is overflowing. (2 seconds)
Um, that’s it.
