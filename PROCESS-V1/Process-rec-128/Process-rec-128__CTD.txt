Pat: (2 seconds) The scene is in a kitchen (1 second) a boy is trying to reach biscuits in a cookie jar in a cupboard and he’s had to stand on the stool in order to do it, but the stool is wobbling. A girl, who is probably his sister, is reaching up to get a biscuit that he’s got out of the jar. There’s a mother by the sink; she’s not looking at what the children are doing. She’s probably just done the washing up, um but she must have left a tap running or a plug in the sink because water is overflowing from the sink. She’s drying a plate and there’s a cup, a saucer and another plate on the worktop at the side of her. She’s wearing a short skirt and an a, what looks like an apron.
