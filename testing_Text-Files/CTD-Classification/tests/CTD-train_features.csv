"Pat: (6 seconds) There’s a little boy getting into the cupboard; um he’s climbed on a stool and is falling off. He’s trying to get the cookie jar. Um, his sister’s waiting for a cookie to be passed down. Um, the mum is drying the pots but she’s left the sink on and the water’s overflowing. There’s pots on the side. Um (1 second) you can see out into the garden. Um (1 second) mum looks too busy to be seeing what the children are doing.

"Pat: Kids, kids getting into the cookie jar; the boy who’s on the stool
is gonna fall over, he’s trying to hand his little sister a cookie.
Mother is not paying attention to the, what the kids are doing; she’s
also not noticing that the sink is overflowing. (coughs) She’s busy
drying a plate. There’s a, a picture through the window; the window is
open and the ca, er above the sink, and I can see er what could be a
garage or it could be another house outside, also a lawn and a pathway.
Then there’s er curtains that are drawn back so that I can see out the
open window. Er, to the right of the sink there’s two coffee cups and a
plate sitting there. Er, mother has er some shoes on; they don’t look
like high heels. Er, the little girl has some kinda shoe on with socks.
The boy has shoes and socks on. Er, the kitchen is arranged to have er
counter tops and the boy that’s getting into the cookie jar has opened a
sh, er a door on the cabinet that’s on the wall.

"Pat: There is a woman washing up, the sink is overflowing, you can see the garden through the window, there’s pots on the side. There are two children; the boy’s climbing on a stool which is falling; he’s trying to get the cookies out of the jar in the cupboard. (4 seconds) The woman is wearing an apron (3 seconds) her feet are getting wet. The curtains are open, the window is open. (8 seconds) In the garden you can see another window in the distance (1 second) and flower beds, a path and the grass. 
",HC
"Pat: OK, this looks like er (1 second) a poster for (1 second) hidden
dangers or, or very visible dangers (laughs) in er the kitchen. There is
the boy falling off the chair er reaching into the co, cookie jar that’s
about to tumble down. There’s the woman standing there with the dishes
overflowing. Um (1 second) she’s standing on water so there’s a, a, I
suppose a, a sli, slip (1 second) s, er well concern of slippage. Er,
she’s looking out the window onto a back garden with the window open; er
are they concerned about burglary? I don’t think they should be cos
nobody’s going to go into that kitchen with her standing there and the
water flowing out. Um, there are cupboards under the sink. Er, there are
some dishes; the size of the sink looks way too small. Um, mm, mm, mm,
mm, mm, looks like the handles are missing on the cupboards (1 second)
so that’s, maybe that’s why they’re keeping the cookie jars
in the top shelves because that’s looks as though they, there’s, there’s
at least one handle that seems to be seen there. The girl is laughing at
her brother cos she wants a cookie, er but she’s also seems to be
shushing ‘em up as though er they don’t want their mu, mum to know
what’s happening. He’s got the lid off the jar, it’s sideways, and he
has a cookie in his hand ready to give to her sister who has her hand
out to receive it.
",Dementia
"Pat: (5 seconds) There is a girl exclaiming (1 second) surprise at the
boy who is standing on the stool which is tipping over (1 second) and he
is about to fall. (1 second) They look as though they were both trying
to get a (1 second) biscuit from a biscuit jar, or a cookie jar, which
is in a cupboard (1 second) they had to use the stool because the
cupboard is quite high. (2 seconds) The lid (1 second) of the cookie jar
is off. Meanwhile (1 second) mum, who is standing with her back to them
(tuts) is obviously thinking about something other than what she’s doing
because the dish that she is wiping (1 second) and drying (1 second) um
(1 second) indicates that she has forgotten that she has left the taps
on and that the sink is overflowing onto the floor. It looks like it
might be a nice day because the window is open and the garden looks as
though it is well kept. They (1 second) are, there are some other items
that have either been washed or are waiting to be washed, um (1 second)
and I would say that the room is more than likely to be a kitchen. (1
second) There are seven cupboards on the, underneath the worktop and er
there is one cupboard with two doors, one of which is open. The curtains
are pulled back and tied up, tied back, and er (1 second) the um (1
second) window that has been pushed up looks as though it has got er
small panes of glass. Um (1 second) and um (1 second) that’s about it
really. The door handles on the cupboards are um (1 second) long thin er
(1 second) objects.
",Dementia
"Pat: It’s what I presume is the mother because she’s the tallest of the
three people, by the sink, which is overflowing, and she’s got a pot in
her hand and a dishcloth; so it looks like she’s ignoring the flow and
she’s just basically carrying on with the, the, the, with that. There is
a window which shows a scene which has got a garden and got another
house outside. Then following on round you have; in the other side of
the kitchen you have the girl and the boy. Now the boy is about to
tumble off the stool cos it is slant, it is leaning and doesn’t look
very stable, but he is determined to reach into the, to, to, to, to the,
ha, hoo, cookie jar at the top, and take as many cookies as he can; it
looks like he’s got quite a handful already. And then, going back over
to the other side of the kitchen where the mother is; yes, there are
pots out on the side and, yes, she is ignoring the flow that’s coming
all over the side. Er, but it does look like they look like they’ve got
sort of maybe quite affluent, because of the, sort of the garden
outside, and the house that you can see outside, and the cur, the way
that the cur, the curtains, and it looks like quite a modern kitchen
because it’s all sort of doors, it’s all fitted doors and er; ooh the
cookie jar tells you that it’s cookies on the front, which if you’re
trying to hide them, which I presume you are by putting them on the top
shelf, it’s a bit silly putting them in a jar that says cookie jar. Well
it is isn’t it? And, and, and, and basically, yeah, he’s about to come a
cropper, he might even fall into; oh no, he might even fall into the
mother who’ll then slip in the water and then there’ll only be the girl
who’s left laughing, and she, while, while they’re doing that on the
floor she will nip over there and she will, she will put the, the, the,
the stool straight and she will climb up there and she will get the
cookies our for herself, mm hmm. Can I finish the question? Yeah.
",MCI
"Pat: It’s a picture of a kitchen; er there are tall cupboards on the
wall, and floor cupboards. Um, the left-hand side there is, there are
three cupboards; the middle cupboard door is open and inside you can see
a cookie jar with the lid off. Er, there are two children standing on
the floor; the little girl is on the floor, the boy is standing on a
stool and he has climbed the stool to go and get a cookie out of the
cookie jar; and he is handing one down to the girl standing on the
floor. On the right-hand side of the kitchen there is a window which
appears to be open, with curtains drawn back. Um, the, the lady is
drying dishes, or washing dishes, one of; probably drying dishes. Er,
the sink seems to have water overflowing onto the floor. Um, next to the
sink are two cups and a plate. Um, all the bottom cupboards are closed;
er (1 second) they have upright (1 second) horizontal, no, vertical
handles. (tuts) Um (1 second) there is no colour in the picture. Through
the window you can see either part of the house or, or another house.
There’s a hedge in front of er the house. There is a path going round
the house. There is a tree in the background and some (1 second) (tuts)
er some grass or shrubs on the right-hand side. (1 second) Um (sighs) (3
seconds) (tuts) that’s it.
",HC
"Pat: (2 seconds) The scene is in a kitchen (1 second) a boy is trying to reach biscuits in a cookie jar in a cupboard and he’s had to stand on the stool in order to do it, but the stool is wobbling. A girl, who is probably his sister, is reaching up to get a biscuit that he’s got out of the jar. There’s a mother by the sink; she’s not looking at what the children are doing. She’s probably just done the washing up, um but she must have left a tap running or a plug in the sink because water is overflowing from the sink. She’s drying a plate and there’s a cup, a saucer and another plate on the worktop at the side of her. She’s wearing a short skirt and an a, what looks like an apron.
",HC
"Pat: There, there, there’s a lady washing up; er she’s left the taps
running and that’s running onto the floor. There’s (1 second) er a child
on a stool which is falling over; he’s trying to get some cookies out of
a jar. Er, the lid’s off the jar. There’s a girl standing by the side of
him. Cupboard door’s open. There’s er, er it looks like two cups and a
plate on the, er on er s, er worktop. There’s er a, the lady is drying a
plate. Um, and outside the window you can see a garden path, er, and
some building out there and some grass. There’s a pair of curtains which
are tied back, er, they, and they’re in a kitchen.
",MCI
"Pat: It looks like a lady, um (?) the mum; er she is washing up, or she looks like she’s drying up, it looks like she has washed up and er the sink is overflowing cos she, it looks like the tap is still running and it’s um splashing out down the cupboards onto the floor. Um, she’s wearing like a 1950s style dress um with a little bit of an apron it looks like, and it looks as though the water is, she’s stood in the water. Um, the window is open and you can see a path and another house maybe and a bit of garden. Um, there’s two kids; there looks to be a boy and a girl. Um, the boy is stood on a stool and he looks like he’s pinching some cookies out the cookie jar which is on the top shelf of the um (tuts) high cupboard and it looks like he might be passing one to what I assume is his sister, but at the same time the stool looks as though it’s on its um, on the edge of its legs and it, it might be tip, it, it is tipping over, and I’m not sure if his sister’s eating a cookie or she’s laughing at him. Um, the, the cupboard door is open, um all the other cup, cupboard doors are shut. Um (tuts) there looks to be a cup and saucer, maybe a bowl and a plate on the side that what I assume is the mum looks as though she’s drying up the plates. Um (2 seconds) yeah, I don’t know if the little girl, she looks to be wearing a skirt or it looks quite, it seems to be quite sure or whether it’s just like a long top and she might be wearing leggings or maybe they’re ankle socks. It’s in black and white and it’s just a line drawing so it, it looks quite um (2 seconds) yeah, difficult to just, just see; there’s a, quite a lot of detail. Um, outside there looks to be a tree, maybe some bushes, the curtains are at the window in um like a sash kind of way and it looks like the window is (1 second) um (tuts) (1 second) yeah, kind of pushed up, er which is open, um, and it’s got um like a square grid on the windows. And mum looks like she’s got quite short hair um, you know, kind of a short bob. The boy looks like he might have dark hair, um just the way that it’s shaded. (7 seconds) I think that’s about it.
",HC
"Pat: (4 seconds) Oh (1 second) it’s in a kitchen scene. Er, the lady at
the sink is in difficulties because the sink is overflowing onto the
floor; she needs to call her insurance company er right away, but
they’ll sort it all out, I’ve no doubt. Um, there’s er a view out the
window and her lawn and I can see some trees and grass growing, and I
think there’s a scaffold out there. There’s a few dishes on the worktop;
two, two what looks like cups and a plate. And the curtains have got
tiebacks on them. And er there’s er a little girl standing on the ground
and what I presume is her brother is balancing very precariously on a
stool on two legs (laughs) I think he’s gonna be on the ground pretty
shortly. He’s at the cookies, cookie jar and he’s, she’s about to
receive one, um, and I think the whole jar could be, is going to be on
the ground very shortly. Er, the er kitchen has got low level (tuts) er
cupboards round, and worktop, and the high level cupboard, which the boy
is er stealing the cookies in.
",MCI
"Pat: Er, do, I press it now to start don’t I?
Oth: No, just.
Pat: Oh. In the, in the um picture I can see er a girl asking a boy to collect something out of a cupboard; he reaches up standing on a stool and falls backward. He was getting something out of a jar. Er, the mother was stood at the sink washing the pots; the sink was overflowing because she was looking out of the window possibly er down the drive. Er, there was a plate and cutlery er on the um, on, on the er side of the sink. Er, the net curtains were open; outside; oh sorry it wasn’t cutlery, it was, I’ve just put my glasses on, it was a cup and saucer, and er her shoes were getting wet through with the er sink overflowing and er outside in the window there was a person, I believe, coming up the drive in the far distance er, um and there was another window and hedge to the left of the picture.
",HC
"Pat: OK, so there’s a lady washing up at the sink and the sink is
overflow, flowing with water, the water is going onto the floor, she is
standing in the puddle that’s on the floor. There’s a young boy standing
on a three-legged chair trying to pinch the cookies from the cookie jar
but it looks as if it’s going to fall over so he’ll get injured. The lid
is off the cookie jar but the cookie jar is, the cookies are coming out.
It looks er, there’s a little girl there which is waiting for one of the
cookies to be passed to her; she’d stood in the floor. The cupboard door
is open. There is a er window which is, has got curtains and outside the
curtains you can see the side of a house and a path leading towards the
house in which they er, the image is, is shown. There are kitchen units,
there are one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight drawers visible
on the er (1 second) on the units; some have handles, some don’t have
handles. The er, the top window has a um (tuts) er a square er frame
within it, um there are also some plates and cutl, um cups and crockery
on the side of the unit. Um (2 seconds) the lady seems to be wearing a,
a pinny and she’s drying the dishes with a tea towel.
",HC
"Pat: (2 seconds) Er, there’s a boy on a stool getting ready to fall;
he’s on a, trying to get cookies out a cookie jar to give to his sister.
Mom’s washing dishes and the sink’s overflowing onto the floor. (5
seconds) That’s about it.
",HC
"Pat: (Tuts) Er, there are three people in the picture; um (1 second) a
woman er drying dishes, um (1 second) a, a boy climbing on a stool
that’s tipping over, and he’s taking cookies from a jar on the top
shelf, and there’s a girl standing next to him er reaching out,
apparently to take a cookie, and she’s pointing to her mouth but maybe
just er giggling or laughing. The sink er that the woman is standing at
is overflowing with water that’s er flooding the floor. Um, on the
worktop where the sink is there’s a (1 second) two cups and a plate. Er,
the curtains are parted, er the window is open, um, and through the
window can be seen the garden and what looks like um an extension or, or
conservatory or some other building. Er, there’s a lawn, er, and a tree.
Er, the window has window bars er (2 seconds) er glazing bars, I should
say. Um, there are one, two, three, four, five um under counter units
and er one cupboard um that the cookie jar is in. The lid is off the
cookie jar and um, as I said, the boy is taking cookies out of it. Er,
he has one cookie in his left hand, which he may be passing to the
little girl who may be his sister. (2 seconds) Er, there is no colour in
the picture; it’s just monochrome.
",HC
"Pat: It’s, looks like a mother that’s washing the pots and she’s left the tap running which, so the water is pooling on the floor; and behind her back the two children are doing something they shouldn’t to get to the cookie jar, which is on the top shelf of a cupboard, and the little boy has, is standing on a tall stool and it’s just in danger of falling over.
",HC
"Pat: Mum’s washing up, water’s flooding all over the sink, she’s got a plate in her hand and a tea-towel; she’s drying the pots. Kids are cli, er kids are messing about taking something out, a jar out the cupboard; the boy’s falling off the stool, the girl’s reaching up for something. The cupboard doors are open and er you can see outside the window. Press forward, press forward, press forward.
",HC
"Pat: (Tuts) There is a woman by a si, an overflowing sink wiping a dish.
Er, on the top beside her there is a plate and two cups. (1 second)
Behind her, at her side, there are two, two children; one is on a stool
that’s toppling over, one is standing on the floor. Um, they’re both er
stealing cookies from the cookie jar in a cupboard. The girl on the, who
is standing on the floor is, has her ar, arm towards her (1 second) um
brother, I suppose, asking for a cookie, and he’s getting more cookies
out of the jar. Out of the window in front of the overflowing sink there
is a picture of a garden which has a footpath and some er hedges, and
another part of the house can be seen outside; er there’s a lawn,
there’s curtains on the window; er the window is open. There are
cupboards underneath the sink um (tuts) and that’s it.
",HC
"Pat: (2 seconds) There’s a woman standing at an overflowing sink; her
foot is in the puddle cos the sink is overflowing onto the floor. She’s
drying a plate. The tap is running into the sink; she should stop it.
There are two cups and a plate on the draining board. Through the cur,
the window near her is outside into the garden, a bit of the building, a
border, and the, there are curtains at the window. A bit further along
the working tops around the corner there are two children; there is a
boy standing on a stool and he’s about to topple over. He’s reaching for
the cookie jar which is out of his reach right at the top of a cupboard;
he’s, and he’s got a cookie in each hand, his sister is waiting for one
standing on the floor but he’s about to collapse at the back.
",MCI
"Pat: So there is a lady, I’m assuming the mother, she is washing dishes
whilst the sink is overflowing and the water is falling over the counter
tops, over the sink onto the floor; she is stepping in the puddle of
water. Er and there is a kid on a stool trying to get the cookie jar
from the open cupboard, er it seems like as though he is falling over
because the stool is falling over. He has a cookie in his hand and he
has his other hand in the cookie jar. And then there is a girl, who is
probably his sister, trying to get the cookie from him, and she is also
laughing.
",HC
"Pat: OK, so the lad’s trying to get into the cookie jar, passing them to his sister, I’m guessing, but he’s about to fall off the stool. Er, mother’s (laughs) drying the plates but the sink’s overflowing. Um, the curtains are open and there’s pots on the side. Er (1 second) there’s er a, a tree outside, there’s a footpath and grass and maybe a hedgerow, er some plants in the border. Er, the curtain’s tied back. Um, hmm, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven cupboard doors, maybe. Er (1 second) and there’s, I can see three, maybe four door handles. Er, the wife’s got a pinny on over her, over her dress, which is er sleeveless. Er, the young lad’s wearing shorts and a, and a top and socks and shoes, and the girl’s got a short skirt, socks, shoes and a top. Er, she’s got shoulder length hair and he’s got, well shortish hair, it’s not very long. Um, mother’s got, yeah, er, er neck length. Er (1 second) phew, that’s about as much as I can see.
",HC
"Pat: Um (1 second) there’s a mum and a boy and a girl in a kitchen;
mum’s doing the wa, washing up, by the looks of it. There’s water on the
floor. (1 second) She’s got some curtains hanging out where she’s
looking out the window, possibly. (1 second) Her son has climbed up to
the cookie jar and is passing the cookies, cookies (1 second) down to
his sister whilst the stool’s (1 second) falls over. (3 seconds) (sighs)
Dunno, dunno what else there is say.
",MCI
"Pat: It’s um, it looks (laughs) like chaos. Mum’s trying to do the er
washing but she’s left the taps on and the sink is overfilling; looks
like the surface isn’t square. Her kids are mucking about in the
background; the older one, possibly the boy, is falling off the stool
whilst he’s trying to pinch, no, whilst he’s trying to reach cookies
from the jar in the cupboard. Um, I don’t know whether his sister’s
saying, shush, be quiet, don’t tell mum. But er the window’s open, she’s
probably listening to the birdsong, she’s got too much on her mind, and
er it looks like chaos.
",MCI
"Pat: It looks like a slightly chaotic (1 second) sce, scene in a kitchen. Er, there are two young children, a boy and a girl; the boy is stood on a stool which is about to fall over. He’s taking (1 second) cookies from the cookie jar in the cupboard. Er, his mother is apparently ignoring him whilst she daydreams looking out of the window with a slightly (1 second) looks like a slightly rural scene, er, and er she’s obviously in a bit of a daydream cos the sink is overflowing and er water is falling onto the floor. 
",HC
"Pat: Um, scene is in the kitchen. There is a woman who’s drying the
dishes and is probably not concentrating on her job because the sink is
overflowing and the water is falling on the floor as she dries the
plate. She’s looking outside; the window seems to be open and you can
see the garden. Meanwhile the children behind her back are going for the
cookies in the cookie jar on the top shelf in the cupboard and the boy,
seems to be a boy, has stood on the stool, and as he’s handing down the
cookie to the girl who’s putting her finger to the lips and telling him
to be quiet, it looks as though the stool is going to topple over and he
will crash to the ground.
",HC
"Pat: ‘50s style er scene of domestic um confusion, er where they’ve got
these rowdy children er doing their own thing, getting in the cookie
jar, and the mother’s completely unaware of it, and she’s thinking of
all sort of things while the sink overflows.
",MCI
"Pat: A mother and two children in a kitchen (sighs) the mother is drying
dishes but the sink is overflowing and water pouring out onto the floor.
The children are (2 seconds) messing about; the son is on a stool which
is about, or in the middle of tipping over as he’s trying to reach a
cookie jar on a high shelf in a cupboard, and what’s probably his sister
is standing beside him with her hand up for a cookie for herself, and
she’s beginning to look slightly worried, I think, about him falling
off. Outside, through the window, you can see a path around the house
and some bushes, um despite the fact that there are curtains at the
window, because they are drawn back quite well. There’s some cups and a
plate beside the sink and the mother is wiping up one plate. (3 seconds)
Not much else.
",MCI
"Pat: There’s a woman in a dress with an apron, short hair, not bad
build, kinda nice tatas, and she is drying dishes at a sink that is
overflowing because she is imagining running off with her lover and
getting away from these two brat kids that are in her kitchen about to
kill themselves because they’re (coughs) climbing to get cookies out of
the cookie jar in the cupboard and (coughs) little, little (1 second)
Donny there, or whatever his dumb name is (coughs) has lost his balance
and he is falling off his stool while his sister, who has all the
compassion of a rock, is laughing at him. He, in the meanwhile, is about
to crack his head open on the cupboard and the counter and probably old
mum there who is day, daydreaming about her lover will have to take him
to the hospital and get stitches.

"Pat: Er, there is a boy precariously (1 second) on a foot stool, which
might topple, being watched by a girl with her hand up, as he pulls a
cookie out of the cookie jar, er while his presumed mother has his back
to them as she’s washing or drying a dish, but meanwhile water is
pouring out of the sink onto the floor. The curtains are open so the
view of the garden outside er is there. (1 second) Er, cupboards are
shut, er, and the mother is, actually has her shoe in a puddle of water.

"Pat: (8 seconds) I can see a boy on a stool; he’s trying to reach for a
cookie jar. His sister is waiting for his, for her brother to hand a

that she’s, or a window that she’s looking at. Um, she’s dressed in a (1

jar itself.

"Pat: (4 seconds) Er, children going and getting cookie jars, although
the (1 second) stool is (2 seconds) slanted, so it looks like they’re
gonna fall. (2 seconds) Er, mother looks (1 second) distressed,
considering she’s left the tap on and it’s overflowing (laughs) er while
she’s washing up. They seem to be in a kitchen with cups and plates and
it looks like the window is open into the garden; and there’s kitchen
cabinets.

"Pat: I see a little boy and a little girl (1 second) foraging in the cupboard. The little boy looks like he’s going to, he’s reaching up high for a jar, a cookie jar it looks like, to pass down one of them to the little girl, but in the process it looks like the stool is going to fall over. They’ve also got the cupboard door wide open. There is a lovely wide picture window in front of the kitchen sink, which is overflowing; it has two taps and through the window I can see another house with Georgian windows. It looks like the mother has got a tea-towel and she’s drying one of the plates and she’s stood in a pool of water where the sink is overflowing. To the side it looks like there’s a plate and two cups above a cupboard with two handles. (1 second) The little girl is wearing ankle socks and a skirt and she’s got (1 second) I would guess, blonde shoulder-length hair. Er, what else can I see? The curtains are on a pole and they’ve got tie-backs on them and they’re gathered joining in the middle. (4 seconds) And that’s about it.

"Pat: There’s a boy on a chair and he looks like he’s tipping over cos
he’s trying to get the cookie jar out the top shelf, and the girl on the

And the mum’s washing pots and she looks like she’s (1 second) er
daydreaming and the sink is overflowing (1 second) and can’t tell what’s
happening outside, if it’s, what the weather’s like, and the water’s

in the kitchen, both a little girl and a, a son. The son is climbing up
on a stool which is falling over, and the little girl is (1 second)
waving her arm about something and intends to, to say something perhaps
about that. Well the mother, well the woman at the sink it’s, the water
has come over the top because the, the plug has obviously been put in

nobody seems to notice. Thank you.

as though there has been um an accident with the sink, the sink is

plate with a, er a dishcloth or a, a, a tea towel. Um, the kids are
stealing the cookies and the er boy on the stool looks as though he’s
just about to fall off the stool cos the stool is standing on two of
three legs and tilting at an angle. Um, the girl is, got a smirk on her
face, she seems to find it all very amusing. The, the boy is trying to
steal so, er biscuits from the cookie jar and mum, I think, is not quite
aware of what’s going on behind her back, and probably just about to
find out, maybe won’t be too pleased, particularly with the sink
overflowing and things not going well in the department she’s looking
after. Um, out of the window there looks like there’s a, a garden and um
sketches of a, a building overlapping the kitchen. Um (2 seconds) that’s
about as much as I can say really.

"Pat: (2 seconds) The picture is of two children, a boy and a girl; the boy is on a stool which is about to (1 second) fall over. It, it’s, he’s trying to take some cookies out of a cookie, cookie jar. The children are in the kitchen with a woman who I suspect is er mother. The, she’s got the taps on at the sink and the si, the sink is overflowing and water is (1 second) going onto the floor. She’s busy drying dishes. Um, within the kitchen there’s a work surface and (4 seconds) a number of cupboards. Um, there’s curtains up at a window; from the window you can see another house, you can see a pathway, you can see the garden, probably a hedge and a tree. On the work surface there’s um (1 second) two dishes, what looks like two dishes and a plate. Um (1 second) the lady has got a dress on and shoes (1 second) and the children both have shoes on and socks.

"Pat: The mother’s washing up, the sink is overflowing (2 seconds)
there’s a garden outside with the window open and some curtains at the
window. The boy and girl are trying to steal cookies; the boy’s on a
stool and about to fall off and the girl is reaching out. It’s in a
kitchen. There are kitchen cupboards (1 second) the mother has an apron
on and is drying dishes (1 second) there’s some plates on the right-hand
side, maybe waiting to be washed up, there’s a path outside the house.
That’s it, I think.
",HC
"Pat: (2 seconds) A mother, I’m assuming it’s a mother, a woman is
washing up and appears slightly distracted as she’s drying something but
the sink is overflowing. There are two children, a boy and a girl; the
boy is on a stool reaching for a cookie jar but appears to be falling
off. Um, it, outside there is a tree, what looks like a drive to the
house with nothing on it. On the sideboards there are a plate and two
cups. There are (1 second) er one, two, three, four (1 second) five or
six (1 second) cupboards. Um, the young girl is wearing a short skirt,
ankle socks, and what look like sandal type shoes. The boy’s also
wearing shorts, his socks are coming down; I can’t tell what he’s got on
his feet. He’s got a ‘50s sort of haircut. Er, the woman is wearing a
pinafore, phew, regular type of flat-sole shoes. Um (1 second) the sink
has got a, a single faucet and two taps. There are curtains that are
tied back, yeah, they don’t appear to be particularly patterned; they’re
tied back from the middle. I can’t see whether there’s a, a curtain
rail. Um (sighs) there’s a window in the, what looks like the extension,
um sma, with lots of small panes of glass. The garden is laid to shrubs;
looks like grass and hedges in the background. The cookies; hard to tell
what they are, they could be chocolate chip, they’ve got lots of spots
in them. Um (1 second) I think that’s about it.
",MCI
"Pat: Goodness, not; a high risk er picture that you’re showing me.
(laughs) There’s a young boy who is attempting to reach, well he has
reached a cookie jar; um he has a biscuit in one hand, which it looks as
though he’s going to hand it to his sister. But he’s balancing
perilously on a stool; in fact the stool is, has already started to, to
top, er fall over; so he’s at risk of injury. Um, meanwhile his mum er
who’s also in the kitchen, um she has her back to the children so she
doesn’t actually know what’s happening, she’s not aware of the danger
that her son, I’m assuming that’s her son, um that he might be in. She
seems to be a, a little bit preoccupied because she’s drying a dish in
her hand but the sink is actually overflowing and the water’s splashing
onto the floor; and it doesn’t appear that she’s aware of that. So she
obviously has something that’s preoccupying her mind um to that degree
that she’s noticing neither the water that’s splashing on the floor um
nor the danger that her, her boy is in er with the stool about to er (1
second) topple over and, and him potentially being injured.

"Oth: (2 seconds) There you go.
Pat: But can you bring it up a bit?
Oth: Yeah.
Pat: (5 seconds) What have I got to do, describe it?
Oth: Yeah.
Pat: Er boy, the picture on the wall, or is it a drawing? I can’t be
certain. Um (1 second) oh, oh it says jar on it, um (1 second) cookie
jar, that’s it. And he’s, he’s stood on a, a tall stool but it’s about
to fall over, he’s wobbled on it. And he’s got er a little girl in front
of him that’s trying to pass him things to put in this er jar; oh it’s a
cupboard, the door’s open. And then his mum’s at the kitchen sink
washing the pots, and er (5 seconds) oh she’s spilling the water, it’s
running down the sink and er (4 seconds) curtains at the window, bit of
a frill along the top (1 second) and er nice cupboards around the
kitchen. (8 seconds) I can’t see a lot else that we can talk about.
Right the mother’s washing the pots; I think I probably said that. (3
seconds) And the cup and saucer and plate on the worktop (2 seconds) and
the water’s spilling out of the sink onto the floor. (Oth coughs)
Oth: Done?
Pat: Mm.
",MCI
"Pat: (5 seconds) Er, there’s a scene in a kitchen with a bit of an
absent-minded lady (1 second) standing in the pool of water from the
overflowing sink while she dreamily washes a, wipes a dish. Er, the, no,
nothing happening in the garden. There’s a little path leading out; the
gate is open. There are two children (1 second) playing quite
dangerously; the boy’s about to fall off a stool while he’s stealing
cookies from a cupboard and handing them down to his sister. There’s a
three-legged stool about to fall over. Um (1 second) the curtains are
held back by some sort of ribbon, and the cupboard door is open,
obviously, so the boy can get into it. (3 seconds) The girl’s wearing (1
second) shoes and socks (1 second) the boy’s socks seem to be falling
down, or he’s got loose boots on, I can’t see quite clearly. (2 seconds)
Anyway, the girl seems to be eating one cookie and reaching out for
another one. (3 seconds) And there’s a, the ki, the, the unit with the
sink in has got (1 second) looks like four cupboards which are closed.
",Dementia
"Pat: I see a scene of absolute chaos in this picture. Mother doesn’t know what the children are doing; the children are having a high old time trying to get to the cookie jar. The lid is off it in an open cupboard. The little boy’s stool on which he is standing is going to topple over any minute now and I’m not sure he or his sister, whom I presume the little girl is, realise what is going to happen, and mother certainly doesn’t know what’s going to happen; I think she’s in dreamland, because not only does she not notice the children she doesn’t notice that the floor is flooding because the water is spilling out of the sink. Er, she’s wiping a plate; she’s probably been doing it for quite a while if she’s got her mind on something else. Out of the window I can see what looks like another house and a path to it, and possibly lawns at the side, or it might be bu (1 second) hedges. Um (2 seconds) there look to be two cups and a plate that mum has already dried up, but why she’s left the taps running I just don’t know. Er, her feet will soon be wet so she’ll realise then. (1 second) Er, and that is a lovely picture. (laughs) What do I press?
",HC
"Pat: (5 seconds) Ooh do you want me to do this now; you’re not taking it
away? OK, it’s a kit, kitchen scene where all sorts of things are going
wrong. There’s probably a mother and a son and daughter, but may not be.
Um, it looks a very old-fashioned depiction of a household; it’s very
American as well, cookie jar. So the mother is, or the woman, the adult,
is washing up but she’s distracted and she’s letting the water overflow
from the sink. Um, she’s drying up at the same time not really paying
attention and it’s all over the floor and splashing everywhere. She’s
not paying attention to anything because the two children there, the,
the boy is climbing on a stool to get to the cookie jar at the high
shelf in a cupboard and he’s about to fall over on the stool, off the
stool, and the girl is laughing at him. He’s reaching a cookie down from
the cookie jar to give her a cookie, but she doesn’t seem to be noticing
that he’s gonna fall over on a three-legged stool. And the woman, the
mother, is also not paying attention to the children; um so she is very
distracted and clearly thinking of other things. She’s standing at the
window and you can, through the window you can see the garden, er, and
there’s a cup and saucer and plate on the side and er water on the
floor. And the children are; what else do you want to know? (1 second)
Children look as though they’re about nine, ten, eleven, doing things
they shouldn’t be doing. It must be summer cos they’re, they’ve got
shorts on and the woman is er, has got no sleeves in her dress; she’s
wearing an apron, she’s drying a plate. Well I think I can finish the
question now can’t I? (mouse click)

"Pat: (5 seconds) Um, looks like mum is washing the pots but not really
concentrating on what she’s doing as she’s left the taps on and the
water is spilling onto the kitchen floor. The children (1 second) are (1
second) messing about at the other side of the kitchen, behind the mum,
and get, trying to get into the cookie jar; they’ve got into the cookie
jar but the boy has stu, stumbled on the stool and is in the process of
falling over. (4 seconds) Um, a little girl is trying to get the, the
cookie off him, as he’s falling over, and she seems to be laughing. Um
(3 seconds) (tuts) but mum doesn’t look very happy at all; she looks as
if she’s just in a world of her own, thinking about other things.
Oth: (4 seconds) (?).

"Pat: (8 seconds) So there’s a boy standing on a stool which looks as though he’s about to fall off. At the same time (1 second) er he is reaching some cookies from a (1 second) jar in the cupboard to (1 second) hand down (1 second) to a girl who’s standing on the floor, so possibly they are (1 second) related (clears throat) maybe brother and sister, er while it looks as though mum is busy working um (1 second) oh I think she’s doing the washing up actually. (1 second) Er, but it looks as though there’s been an accident and the taps won’t turn off so the water is spilling over (clears throat) from the sink onto the floor and she’s standing in a puddle of water. At the same time she’s continuing to dry er a plate that presumably she’s washed. Um (clears throat) (1 second) outside (1 second) er there looks to be, through, through the window there looks to be some trees and possibly um a lattice fence. The curtains are tied back with ties.

"Pat: A lady standing at a sink doing the washing up; um (1 second) the
sink’s filled up with water and is overflowing. Er, two children (1

some cookies from a cookie jar in the (2 seconds) cupboard, the high
level cupboard in the kitchen. (1 second) Er (sighs) the kitchen’s got a

children was a, a boy and a girl.

"Pat: Kitchen scene (sighs) the woman is just wiping dishes. The sink is,
the water’s running out of the sink. (2 seconds) There’s a woman’s head
outside, out; oh maybe it’s a planter; there are two children, a boy and
a girl; the boy is standing on a ladder reaching up (1 second) to get
into the cookie jar. (4 seconds) Curtains up at the windows; I can see
one where they’re both tied back. (2 seconds) It looks like two cups on
the sink, side of the sink, and a plate. (2 seconds) Mm. (3 seconds) If
he doesn’t watch out he’s going to fall off the stool. (3 seconds)
Little girl is holding hand, her hand up to receive some cookies out of

can see another house behind (1 second) and what looks like a hedge. (2
seconds) Oh, oh, oh one, two, three, four, five, six (3 seconds) six
cupboards under the sink, three cupboards (1 second) over the work
surface where the children are looking up to get into the cookie jar. (2
seconds) I think that’s about it.
",MCI
"Pat: Well I guess the lady of the house is er off in another world thinking about other things; her sink is overflowing while she’s absentmindedly drying a plate and her children are standing on a very tall stool which is unsafe and is about to fall over as they’re currently raiding the cookie jar. What on earth is a cookie? It’s a biscuit jar. Er, it’s very American this system. Um, outside it looks like a nice day; she’s got curtains in the kitchen, which is unusual these days, and I don’t know what’s happened to the overflow from the sink cos I would have thought it ought to have operated before the sink er overflowed on the floor. Um, there’s not very much in, no bills and rubbish on the work surface like there is at our house. Er (2 seconds) other than that’s it’s er, that’s about it, I think. (4 seconds) She could do with a bit of a wakeup call, that mother, she’s not paying attention is she? (laughs)
",HC
"Pat: The sink is overflowing; the woman doing the washing up hasn’t appear to have noticed. Er, a boy is falling off a stool trying to get into the cookie jar, possibly on behalf of his sister. The curtains are drawn back; there’s quite a nice garden view. The kitchen is kind of interestingly clean and modern, um but it’s a rather surreal image actually. It suggests a ni, a negligent mother who’s not paying attention to her children or the washing up; maybe there’s a lover somewhere in the picture, out, out of the picture. It’s an interesting one. Er, that’s about as much as I’ve got to say about it.
",HC
"Pat: OK, er the scene is set in a kitchen; er presumably mother at the sink drying the dishes. There is a sink and the tap is running and overflowing and the water’s spilling onto the floor. Um (tuts) you can see through the open window um another house and driveway, and tree outside. Er, behind the, the mother are two children, a boy and a girl; the boy is stood on a stool which is actually, er appears to be falling over and they are attempting to get cookies out of a cookie jar on the top shelf of a cupboard. Um, the boy’s passing cookies to er (1 second) a young girl, probably his sister, who’s reaching up for them. (tuts) Er, that’s it (1 second) finished.

"Pat: (2 seconds) The kids are stealing, trying to steal cookies out of
the jar but one of them’s, the boy named John is about to fall; he’s
passing cookies down to his sister, Chloe. Mum is distracted and
probably been on the gin again and there is a flood appearing with water
coming out of the sink; and she’s not really concentrating on that,
she’s bored and more concentrating on something else that’s more
important to her, or worried about something else. There, she is staring
out of the window looking at the grass that is overgrown and, in, in the
front garden, and the gate, where the sun is coming in.

"Pat: There’s er a woman washing pots, well she’s washing or drying pots at the sink but she’s not concentrating. The sink is overflowing um; there’s, window is looking out onto the garden. There are two children behind her, one of whom has climbed onto a high stool to steal um cookies, um, and he’s male. Um, there’s a girl, the other child is a girl, er she’s reaching up for him to give her one of these cookies but the chair is toppling over.

"Pat: (2 seconds) Er (1 second) well that is a kitchen (1 second) that is
a kitchen. (4 seconds) Well the mother, the mother is washing the dish
but somehow the water, the, the, er she forgot to, to turn off the er (1
second) the switch and the water are falling on the ground from the
sink. The kids, there are two kids, er (1 second) there, there, there
are two kids. I think it’s a little boy er (2 seconds) I’ve er (1

looks like the stool is falling down (1 second) he’s trying to get some
cookie for his daugh, for his er sister. (3 seconds) Yeah, his mother
was, was, was trying to er, to dry out the er, the plate, she, she,
she’s trying to see, see things outside but he forgot, she forget er to
switch off the er (1 second) um the, the sink. So that’s, that’s why the
water comes out (1 second) too much water. The foo, the foo, so foo, er
it’s flow out, overflow. (laughs) Yeah (1 second) that’s it.
",HC
"Pat: It looks like things, it looks like; it’s in a kitchen, it’s a
kitchen scene, um, and it looks like there’s a few accidents that are
about to happen. We have mum stood at the sink washing up and the sink
is overflowing onto the floor causing a, a, perhaps a potential slip
hazard, um, or potential flooding um if she doesn’t turn the taps off.
We have two children who are trying to get to a cookie jar on the top
shelf of one of the cupboards. Um, the girl’s stood on the floor
reaching up for a cookie whilst the boy is stood on a stool which is
starting to tip over and he has his hand in the cookie jar. So the
stool’s starting to tip over and it looks like he could um end up
falling on the floor when it does. Um (1 second) mum’s; the sink is near
the window and we can see out of the window that there’s um what looks
like a nice garden, um, and we can see that there’s um some cups and a
plate on the side, either to wash up or that have been washed up. Um (1
second) that’s as much as I can say really without starting to repeat
myself.

"Pat: Um, it seems to be a woman, probably a mother, standing at the sink
er washing the dishes. Er, she’s left the tap on and the sink is
overflowing and forming a puddle under the sink, er which she’s standing
in. Er, the kitchen sink is in front of a window, er it looks out onto
what could be er a front or a back garden, and to the left of her is a
building which could be a garage or a barn or; no, actually it’s part of
the house because you can see curtains hanging in there. Um, she’s
drying or washing a plate and on the counter in front of her are a
couple of cups and another plate. Um, standing behind her are two
children, a boy and a girl; er the girl has got short socks and short,
flat shoes and a, a short skirt. Um, her brother or the male child is
standing on a stool which is toppling over and just on two legs; so I
think it’s all going to end very badly. Um, he’s got his hands in a
cookie jar; er it looks like there’s a pile of four or five very nice er
chocolate chip cookies or, or chippy cookies. The lid’s off and he’s got
a cookie in his left hand; he looks like he’s trying to take one with
his right for the little girl, er but I suspect in a moment um the
stool’s gonna topple over, he might take the jar with him. I’m really
not sure why the mum’s letting the sink overflow except that I think she
must be very distracted in some way.

"Pat: (6 seconds) (sighs) Well (1 second) it’s a kitchen and there’s a
little lad standing on a stool, which he shouldn’t be doing, up at a jam
jar, and the little girl next to him, which is, I presume, his sister,
is just holding her arm out uselessly. And then I go further round the
picture; mum is washing up but she’s had a disaster, she needs a
plumber, I’m just the man, she’s flooding the place, and she’s washing
the plates up but she’s, she’s not doing very well. But er there’s a
pair of lovely curtains in’t there, I didn’t know curtains had them in
the kitchen, but anyhow that’s that. I don’t know what happened to the
little boy, he’s only halfway down, he maybe went full down and (1

quite, quite nice, she’s the sorta girl I would go after actually. But

into a cupboard where there is a cookie jar and some biscuits; he
appears to be falling off the stool. He has a biscuit in his hand and
one hand in the jar. He has short hair (alert sound on computer) he has
socks and shoes on. In the same room his mum is stood at the kitchen
sink with the water overflowing, the tap running, the water is running
onto the floor; she is drying a dish and appears not to have noticed
that the water is running. She is wearing an apron, shoes, a dress, and
she has hair just on her chin. She’s stood by the window, the win; the
curtains are open. I can see another house outside; a tree, grass,
hedges, probably window. On the worktop there are two cups, a plate.
There are one, two (1 second) three cupboard doors where I can see the
handles; one cupboard door open and maybe three or four others closed.
There is no colour in the, the picture; it is all black and white. (2

two taps (1 second) with one spout, so one tap pouring into the sink. (2

little bit scared cos he’s falling off the stool. (7 seconds) The lady,

off the stool because it seems to be tilting backwards, and the mother
has absolutely no idea what the children are up to. She is standing in

lady who’s doing the drying up actually has her feet in the water and is
getting wet, not only because the sink is overflowing but also because
it’s now running across the floor. The cookie jar has its lid off but it
looks as if it’s so full that the lid couldn’t even fit on. Outside the
window, which is curtains, which are held back by some kind of rope,
there’s a garden where you have some kind of trestle and the window

doesn’t seem to realise it’s a problem. Er, meanwhile the boy is trying
to get some cookies for him and his sister; he’s just handing a cookie
down to his sister while getting another one. The cookie jar is on the
top shelf; he’s standing on a stool and the stool is just about to fall

"Pat: (1 second) So there is a picture of a, I, I’d argue, perhaps a
family; there’s a mother, two children. There um is a, the mother is
standing by a window, got the window open, she’s washing up a plate; she
could perhaps be, argue, daydreaming or distracted because she’s washing
a plate and as she’s doing it the sink is overflowing. So she may be
distracted when she’s been thinking about turning the tap off, and the
other reason I’d argue that she’s distracted is because she’s also got
the two children, or whoever they are, in the background kinda doing
dangerous things. So one of them is standing on a stool in order to be
able to get to a cupboard which is open and to access a cookie jar,
which is on the top shelf. They’re also trying to um pass it down to a
girl as well, perhaps their sister, and that might be the reason that
they’ve kinda gone off balance as they’re doing it, when they’re taking
the cookies out. Outside the window looks like you’ve got a tree, a
bush, and it’s kinda showing part of the neighbour’s garden as well.
There are a number of different cupboards in the room; some of these are
at lower level, there’s some at high level. On the side of the (1
second) sink there are different um plates, there’s different cups there
as well, and there’s also in the curtain, you can see that one curtain
is tied back, perhaps the other one isn’t, but you can’t tell because
the view’s kind of ex, obscured from where the, the lady’s standing. I
think she perhaps has got an apron on as well while she’s doing the
washing up. (3 seconds) The water, where it’s overflowing, is splashing
off the side as it goes down into forming a pool as well, so perhaps
it’s been on for a while, it’s not just started to overflow. (2 seconds)
On the cookie jar you can see that the lid’s open and that you can see
the cookies in there, as well as it being labelled as a cookie jar. The
child, I think they’ve got one in their hand already and they’re going
for a second one that they’re passing on. The girl has got socks on and
kinda sandal shoes and the boy has perhaps got boots on, it’s hard to
tell what they are. Um (1 second) the mum, or whoever she is, has got
sorta bob hair and the girl’s got perhaps got a bit longer, and I
think she’s got a fringe, as does the mum. Um, the boy who’s climbing up
has kinda got some hair that’s brushed backwards.

"Pat: (3 seconds) Er, it looks like a sunny day, the window might be open (1 second) the (1 second) the curtains open like a theatre onto the stage of the garden, which is very traditional, the path leading to a gate.

There’s a tree (1 second) er there’s another house (2 seconds) er with curtained windows er draped sideways in the distance in the window. There are two cups and a plate on the draining board, and the lady who is presumably a mother dressed in a dress and (1 second) apron, waist size apron, she’s wiping a plate, a dinner plate, and there’s another one of those on, on the counter top. The sink is overflowing, I can’t see which tap is turned but there’s a, er (1 second) an elbow of er (1 second) water in the centre so it’s a mixer tap.

Um, he’s about to fall, she’s reaching up to take her cookie; she may already have one in her mouth (?) and it’s reaching towards her mouth. She also has a fringe and a slightly longer bob. The boy’s hair has a curl at the front and (1 second) er (1 second) is short at the back.

"Pat: It looks like a family morning where they’re (2 seconds) getting
ready to (1 second) go out somewhere. The little boy’s climbing up on a
chair to the cookie jar and the little girl’s holding out her hand to
waiting for one. Er, the mother is washing up but overflowing the sink.
And the boy’s about to fall off the chair because he’s leaning too far
to the right. (18 seconds)
",MCI
"Pat: Little boy falling off a chair whilst passing a jar of something to his sister, who is waiting to collect it. The lady of the house is currently washing up from an overfilling er basin. Outside there is a picture of the garden where nobody is  sitting, sitting or using. There are dirty washing, dirty plates to wash um when the lady gets round to it, having soaked her feet in the overflow water. Rather frightening picture in truth. It’s a daylight picture; therefore the curtains are drawn open. Oh.
",HC
"Pat: (2 seconds) I see a woman doing the dishes with an angry look on
her face; she’s not paying attention as the water is overflowing. I see
two children trying to get cookies out of a cookie jar; a little girl is
holding her hand out, a little boy is reaching into the cookie jar, but
he’s about to fall as the stool is precariously leaning in one
direction. Er, the window is open to their house; I can see bushes and a
tree through the window. On the counter next to the lady doing the
dishes is two tea or coffee cups and a plate. She’s wearing a dress with
an apron. The little girl is wearing shoes and socks, er a dress and a
shirt. The little boy is in what appears to be shoes and socks, he’s got
shorts and a shirt on. It appears to be a somewhat nice house as the
kitchen appears to be large. Looking through the window, I’m assuming
that’s another part of the house that extends off to a ninety degree
angle indicating that it will probably be a very large house. Er, it
also looks like there’s some bushes in the front yard and (1 second)
some grass and a tree. (3 seconds) The little boy has (1 second) nicely
done hair, so does the little girl; the mother’s hair appears to be (1
second) er (1 second) well taken care of. Everybody is of a normal
weight. Er, there is no colour in the photograph other than black and
white. Yeah, that’s about it.
",HC
"Pat: (1 second) Two kids er going into cupboard on a stool, which they
shouldn’t be. Mum’s got sink running and water’s piling over sink, cos
she’s obviously not watching what she’s doing. Er, she’s washing pots.
Er, she’s looking out of window in garden. (4 seconds) The kids are
reaching for cookies and tool’s about to, er stool’s about to fall over
cos they’re, they’re stood on it wrong.
",MCI
"Pat: It looks like it’s in a kitchen; looks like a mum and her two
children. She’s been washing the pots, she’s drying them, there’s water
overflowing from the sink. (1 second) There’s a window; she, she’s like,
I look out into other houses with curtains. There’s a girl and a boy,
the boy’s on a stool; he’s stood on it trying to reach something out of
a cupboard and is falling off it. (1 second) The little girl’s looking
up 
",MCI
"Pat: (2 seconds) There is a young boy trying to get cookies out of a
cookie jar on a stool which is about to collapse. The woman is standing
by the sink washing up but the water is flowing out onto the floor,
which is making it dangerous. The window appears to be open and (3
seconds) the water’s overflowing into the sink; and that’s about it
really.
",Dementia
"Pat: So on the left-hand side you’ve got what looks like a young girl
with a finger on her mouth, or near her mouth and her left arm reaching
upwards towards her brother, who appears to be stood on top of a stool
which is leaning backwards um as he’s reaching for a cookie jar which is
on the top shelf of a kitchen cabinet, um, and in his left hand he seems
to be passing the young girl a cookie and his right hand is holding onto
the cookies in the cookie jar; and then as you come into the centre it
seems like it’s the corner of the cabinets in the kitchen. And then the
right-hand side of the image is a mother who is washing the dishes;
she’s got a towel in her right hand and she’s wiping a plate. She’s in a
short dress with what looks like an apron around her waist and like
ballet shoes, and the sink is overflowing water onto the floor and, and
over the cabinets, and on the right-hand side of that is a couple of
dishes which have probably already been washed. And then in front of her
um is a windowsill where you can see a bush and another part of a house,
either her own or a different house.
",HC
"Pat: (3 seconds) Oh.
Oth: Just, just describe the picture.
Pat: Right, boy and a girl; boy on a stool which is falling over, girl reaching up. They’ve got to a cookie jar; he’s handing her a cookie. He looks like he’s gonna fall fr, on his back. Mum’s there drying the pots (laughs) the sink’s full and there’s water pooling on the floor; mum seems oblivious, kids are oblivious. Er, there’s a lot of health and safety issues at stake. There’s some pots there that look as if they’ve been dried. Um, and then looking through the window, there’s a bit of a driveway and a bit of a garden, um there’s sort of like square panelled window, there’s some curtains with tiebacks, there’s about si, eight cupboards; the one that’s, with the cookie jar is a jar. Um (1 second) they seem to be quite happy, the boy and the girl, at the moment, till he breaks his neck. Um (1 second) yeah, there’s lots of er issues going off there. Mum’s making sure that the pots are clean. Interesting to see that it’s a woman who’s drying the pots and doing the pots and looking after the children, rather than a man; um (1 second) I suppose that’s par for the course. Er, I can see some trees in the backgro, ground through the window. I can see what looks like the roof of another house and I can see, it looks like shrubs but it could be people, in the distance. Yes, mum, even though she’s standing in the pool of water is totally oblivious and she looks like she’s come off the old Fairy um washing up liquid advert and she’s sorta posing there. Cookie jar is absolutely enormous but, judging by them, they’re not part of the obesity crisis; the, the two children are quite slim. It looks quite a dated um picture, probably 1950s/1960s um circa. Um, I don’t know whether that water’s hot or cold, but if it’s hot then she could burn herself. I can see some handles on the cupboard doors, um, and (1 second) yeah, she’s got like a sleeveless dress on and a, an old-fashioned like pinny over the top of it and knee-length skirt and sort of little pumps on and she’s got her hair sort of to her ears in a sort of bob, with a fringe. Doesn’t look like she’s got makeup on, she’s not wearing glasses. I can’t see that she’s wearing any bracelets, earrings or jewellery at all.
",HC
"Pat: OK. Well there’s a lady washing dishes at the sink, which is overflowing and flooding the kitchen. Er, there are some other dirty plates on the top of the worktop. Er, the lady’s wearing a dress and a pinny; she looks quite young. I can see a garden outside with er the path and a bit of lawn. Curtains which are drawn back nearby. There are two children; one is stood on a stool and trying to get to the cookie jar and he’s passing a cookie down to a little girl but the stool is just about to fall over. Er, the cupboard door is open. Er, I think that’s just about everything.
",HC
"Pat: This shows a picture of a mother washing up in the sink where the
water is rowing, um (tuts) flowing over the side; she’s trying to wipe a
plate. She’s looking away from two children who are behind her; she’s
actually at an open window, by the looks of things. The children behind
her are messing about um looking for some biscuits from a cookie jar, by
the looks of things. There’s a girl and a boy; the little boy has
climbed onto a three-legged stool, um, and he has his hand in the cookie
jar. The little girl is on his left; and the stool is toppling, is
beginning to topple backwards and she’s thrown up her um left arm um
presumably in horror, I don’t know, can’t really see their faces
properly. Um (5 seconds) other than that, there’s wash, er there are
bits of crockery on the side where mum is doing the um washing up (1
second) and she’s obviously not seen what the children are doing. (4
seconds) The curtains are (1 second) part um (?) yeah.
",MCI
"Pat: Um, er the mother is wiping the pots and the sink is overflowing with water. Um (2 seconds) er and the children, one, the little boy’s stood on a stool reaching the jar of biscuits in the cupboard and the little girl, the little girl’s standing at the side of him reaching out for him to pass her the biscuits. And outside the window um I can’t really see anything that’s happening out there. Um, er the, the stool is er tippling over with the little boy on so he’s gonna fall in a minute.
",HC
"Pat: (4 seconds) There’s a lad stood on the stool that’s falling off,
trying to reach down for the cookie jar. (2 seconds) His sister’s stood
there waiting (1 second) with her hand risen, er (tuts) raised to take a
cookie. Er, a mum’s doing washing up but she’s left the taps on and the
sink is overflowing. (1 second) Window’s open (1 second) and on the side
is two cups and a plate; and she’s washing a plate. (5 seconds)
",MCI
"Pat: (2 seconds) The picture shows a woman who appears to have been
doing some washing up, two children playing, one of them falling off a
stool, and the other one reaching out towards him; he’s got his hand on
a cookie jar. The sink is overflowing and the water is running onto the
floor and the woman’s feet; she’s busy looking out of the window at the
garden in the distance. (3 seconds) It appears to be a reasonably modern
er kitchen; it’s got er kitchen units (2 seconds) curtains at the
window. (1 second) (sighs) (3 seconds) I’ve said the sink’s overflowing
haven’t I? Er (1 second) appears to be a nice garden path through the
window. (1 second) I think I’ve finished.
",MCI
"Pat: There’s a (1 second) children stealing, or taking cookies from a cookie jar, er handing to another; er that’s the male child handing it to a female child. He’s on a stool which is toppling over so he’s likely to fall if he’s er, doesn’t do something about it. It’s in a kitchen; er he’s, he’s (?) from the upper (1 second) upper side of the kitchen, the upper (1 second) er cupboards. Er, but there’s lower cupboards. There’s er a lady, well I assume to be the mother, who’s washing up but she’s allowing the sink to overflow onto the floor and she’s got a window that looks out onto a garden path, er (1 second) and she’s obviously preoccupied cos she’s allowing the sink to overflow. And there’s curtains at the window and (1 second) the window is half open so it looks as though there’s air coming in.
",HC
"Pat: (1 second) Yeah, it’s a, it appears to be a kitchen where some lady
is potentially cleaning the pots but the water’s overspilling from the
sink. There’s childrens trying to get hold of the cookies in the (1
second) cupboard and it appears the boy is about to fall over the stool.
(1 second) There’s pots on the (2 seconds) worktop and there appears to
be a bit of a image of some kind of a garden through the, the kitchen
window.
",MCI
"Pat: (2 seconds) It’s in a kitchen; er a little boy has climbed onto the
chair er, which is now toppling over, so that he can get to the cookie
jar. He is managing to get some out before he falls, and hand them down
to the little girl who’s beneath him. The lady is er washing up at a
kitchen window which is open, er, and her water is flowing out of the
bo, out of the kitchen basin onto the floor. She is drying up a plate;
there is a plate and two cups beside her. The curtains are open (2
seconds) er there are cupboards beneath the, the sink, er (1 second) and
the boy’s cupboard is up, obviously up in the air. Er (1 second) he is
just wearing socks, his sister’s wearing shoes, the mother is wearing
shoes and an apron. Er (1 second) (sighs) gosh, er (2 seconds) (sighs) I
can’t see anything else. Um (2 seconds) what else? The taps are turned
on full, which is why it’s overflowing. Er (1 second) the little boy’s
in shorts and a shirt, the skirt, er the girl is in a skirt and a
t-shirt, er mother’s got a dress on under her apron. You can see the
eaves of the rest of the house through the open window; there are trees
and plants in the garden. (2 seconds) I can’t really see anything else.
",MCI
"Pat: (1 second) It looks like a woman with her children in the kitchen. She’s doing the washing up with an overflowing basin; the children are trying to get some cookies out of a jar and they’re on a top shelf of the cupboard. The boy is standing on a stool which is tipping over and he’s falling (1 second) over.
",MCI
"Pat: (2 seconds) A lady is washing up at the sink; er the water, the
sink is overflowing, the water’s (1 second) flowing onto the, the floor
around her feet. Um, she’s, she’s drying some pots as she’s standing
over the sink. Meanwhile, in the background, there are two children, a
boy and a girl; er boy is standing on a stool with a, an open cupboard
and a cookie jar on the second shelf in, in the cupboard. Um, the jar is
open and the boy seems to be handling, handing cookies down to um his
apparent sister, to a girl who’s standing on the floor. Um (4 seconds)
and there are, there are curtains which are open showing a garden and a
house. Um (1 second) and (1 second) all of this is going on in the
corner of a kitchen with kitchen units. Um (5 seconds) the (2 seconds)
(sighs) if it’s the mother, the lady is wearing a dress, er the boy is
wearing shorts and the little girl is wearing a skirt and top, or maybe
that’s a dress as well. Um, the boy (1 second) looks to be precarily,
precariously balanced on a stool while he’s er attempting to get the
cookies out of the jar.
",MCI
"Pat: (2 seconds) Oh this is, looks as though it’s a picture of a (1
second) family or part of a family in the kitchen. There’s a lady
standing by the sink drying a plate but doesn’t appear to have noticed
that the water from the sink is overflowing onto the floor. Behind the
sink there’s a window looking out over a neat suburban garden with
curtains over the window drawn back to each side. The kitchen is fitted
with units and at the other side of the kitchen there are two children
trying to get some cookies from a cookie jar. Unfortunately the boy,
the, looks like slightly the older of the two children, er is toppling
over on the stool and is about to fall on the floor (4 seconds).
",HC
"Pat: (?) I thought I had to use the buzzer. Yeah, I can see er a young man trying to get something from, from the cupboard, er but obviously be, being supported by a stool but the stool doesn’t stay still, er almost in a falling position. Young lady on the kitchen floor (1 second) er possibly mother or lady who’s wiping utensils er near the wash, washing basin. Er, I could see water dripping on the floor, curtains, window (1 second) er (1 second) er nice kitchen fitting (2 seconds) yeah.
",HC
"Pat: (3 seconds) OK, well there’s a boy stood on a stool, a three-legged stool, which is obviously overbalanced and he’s obviously looking like he’s about to fall on the ground. Er, he’s got hold of a er, er a cookie jar, so it looks as though that’s going to fall out of the shelf of the er overhead cupboard where he falls over er backwards. Um, there’s a, a woman looking like she’s doing the washing up but left the tap running and the water is flowing over the edge of the sink onto the floor. Um, looks like there’s obviously some malfunction with the um, er (3 seconds) with the waste um overflow pipe in the sink because it should contain excess um, er water rather than allowing it to er go over the top edge of the sink. (2 seconds) Um (2 second) it looks as though she’s got her feet in the water; so I guess that’s going  to make the floor slippery and er put her in peril of er, er slipping. Um, she’s drying a dish er with a cloth, um but if she slips that dish is likely to er fall on the floor and break and could be dangerous. Um (4 seconds) I think, at the moment, that’s probably about as much as I can er see in terms of hazards there. Er, possibly the um young girl is er close to where the er cookie jar is likely to fall out of the cupboard so she might actually get involved in um some other dangers er going on within that er scenario.
",HC
"Pat: (?) there’s an overflow on the si, sink, er three people, three
people in the picture; one had a female, one youth, boy, and one a girl.
The boy is standing very er on, wiggly on a chair which he’s going to
fall off and er do himself a lot of damage.
",MCI
"Pat: (2 seconds) This looks like a mother (1 second) that is distracted;
she’s got the sink overflowing with water while she’s doing dishes.
She’s no doubt got the kids driving her crazy. One boy (1 second) on a
step-stool (1 second) reaching into a cookie jar; looks like the stool’s
falling over so he’s gonna fall and maybe bonk his head. His little
sister’s asking for a cookie and she’s kinda laughing (1 second) and it
is just a very chaotic scene. Looks like there’s, you know, an open
window with a view to the outside that’s above the sink. Um, can’t tell
what kinda day it is cos it’s a black and white picture. (1 second)
That’s it.

"Pat: (5 seconds) You have two children, a boy and a girl, and a lady (2
seconds) um she’s wiping up, the water’s running overflowing. (1 second)
The children, one of the children’s on a stool and they’re in a cupboard
and it’s falling over, the chair. (2 seconds) Um (3 seconds) there’s
pots on the side. (4 seconds) They’re in the kitchen (2 seconds) and
they have curtains up at the window (1 second) and you’re looking onto
the garden (2 seconds) and you can see a building outside it. (13
seconds) Mm.

"Pat: (8 seconds) Um, a woman washing dishes but the machine is er, not
the machine, the sink is overflowing onto the floor and wetting all her
feet. Er, the male and female child, the male child is stood on a stool
that’s falling over and he’s trying to get a cookie out of something
labelled the cookie jar, and the girl is holding her hand up that she
wants one passing to her. Er, the woman’s side of where she’s stood at
the sink, she’s er wiping a plate with the water splashing onto the
floor, which I’ve already said. There’s two cups and what appears to be
another plate er there already waiting. And the view out of the window
is a garden with a path and what looks like some kinda plant that’s
about two foot high, straggly, and then on the, that’s on the right-hand
side; on the left-hand side there’s like a mound of something that could
be plants, and then something, it looks like it’s another building
through the window, you can see the roof of another building.

"Pat: Um, there is a lady doing the washing up um but she’s left the, the
sink um overspilling and it’s going onto the floor. There’s a boy on a
stool; he’s reaching up to um (tuts) get the cookie jar and um a little
girl is reaching up too. It looks like he’s passing the cookies on the
cooking jaw, from the cookie jar. Um (tuts) the lady is stepping into
the water that’s splashing um out of the sink, um, and she is wiping a
