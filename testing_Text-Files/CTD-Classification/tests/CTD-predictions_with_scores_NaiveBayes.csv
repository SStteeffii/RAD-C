one which he’s passing to the little girl, I assume is his sister, he’s
got the other one in his hand. He doesn’t seem the least bit bothered

Out in the garden, as I say, you can see some trees, a path, grass, possibly another house in the background as well, I can see some curtains in another window. Um, the lady’s standing in the water and so she’s not paying much attention to what she’s doing; she must be looking at something really interesting er cos she must have very wet feet. The little boy has socks and shoes on, they appear to be, the socks appear to be falling doo, down. The little girl also has socks and shoes on. Um, ch-ch-ch-ch,let me see what else can I see? I think that’s probably about everything. Um, let me see; there’s one, two, three, four, five, six, seven cupboards under, under the work surface and one, two, three, four, sorry, one, two, three above it. Um (2 seconds) the curtains are held back in place; I think I’ve probably already mentioned that. There’s not a great deal there that I can see really. The little girl is sort learning over backwards slightly um rea, as she’s reaching her hand up to take the cookie from the er, the little boy. (2 seconds) Um, no, that’s pretty much it that I can see. (1 second) Yeah, I can’t, can’t spot anything else; I think I’ve gone through everything.

Process-rec-099,"Pat: (3 seconds) Er, the adult female is washing up, um, and not paying
attention to the water overflowing the sink. Er, the children are
stealing biscuits by climbing on a stool; er the boy who has climbed on
the stool is falling off, er, and the girl is not, is trying to (1
second) get the biscuit that he’s stolen um but not (1 second) trying to
stop him from falling, um. (6 seconds)

Process-rec-151,"Pat: (1 second) It’s a picture of what I think is a kitchen and there’s a woman in the kitchen who’s drying dishes, oh which I think have been washed; there’s water falling onto the floor from the sink. So the floor is wet and I think her shoes are wet too. She’s wearing a sort of apron over her dress. There are curtains at the window and through the window you can see another house and some garden. On the shelf, sorry, on the base unit near her in the kitchen there is some crockery which she, I think, has dried and put down, and there are kitchen cupboards. There are two children in the room; one of them is on, perched on a stool and about to topple over, he’s actually falling over onto the ground. His arms are reaching out to a chocolate or cookie jar in the cupboard; the cupboard door is open and he’s reaching out to pull out the container, the tin with these things inside, he’s knocked the lid off and he’s just about to pull out the jar with these cookies or whatever they are inside. And there’s a little girl watching him who is holding up her hand as if to help, but she’s not quite sure what she can do. She’s wearing a dress with shoes and he’s wearing shorts and a little jumper, t-shirt, and he’s got shoes on as well. There are kitchen base units and top units where they are, where the children are.

Process-rec-076,"Pat: So it’s in a kitchen, looking like a very old like traditional
household, probably from like ‘50s or ‘60s or something. Um, there’s a
boy trying to get up to the cookie jar in a top shelf of the cabinet.
The cabinet door, for some reason, comes out of the square of the (1
second) drawing. Um, he’s falling off of his stool while the little girl
laughs at him. There’s a woman at the sink, she’s washing her dishes
and, for some reason, completely oblivious to the fact that her sink and
entire kitchen seems to be on a slant, cos not only is it just spilling
over onto the side but it’s specifically spilling onto the floor; and
that’s quite the hazard and I think, I don’t think that would um (1
second) that would get away with building regs, to be honest. You can
see the outdoors; they’ve got, I was about to say a garden but it looks
more like a path that goes round a nearby house. Um, yeah, you can see
through that window because the curtains are indeed open mostly. A few
plates and dishes on the side. Yeah, none of the um counter doors are
open, only the cabinet door with the little boy. Um, the woman’s in a
dress, the girl’s in a skirt, the boy’s in shorts and (1 second) yeah,
think that’s about it. (10 seconds) If it can still be heard, for some
question the finish the question button is starting to make my Chrome
freeze (1 second) unsure why. (6 seconds)
